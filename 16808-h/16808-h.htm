<a name="Page_1" id="Page_1"></a></h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I" />CHAPTER I</h2>

<h4>FIRST STEPS IN WAR</h4>

<p>It is given to some regiments to spread their
achievements over the quiet centuries, while to the
lot of others it falls to live, for a generation or two,
in an atmosphere of warlike strife and ever present
danger. The Guides have been, from a soldier's
point of view, somewhat fortunate in seeing much
service during the past sixty years; and thus their
history lends itself readily to a narrative which is
full of adventure and stirring deeds. The story of
those deeds may, perchance, be found of interest to
those at home, who like to read the gallant record
of the men who fight their battles in remote and
unfamiliar corners of the Empire across the seas.</p>

<p>To Sir Henry Lawrence, the <i>preux chevalier</i>,
who died a soldier's death in the hallowed precincts
of Lucknow, the Guides owe their name and origin.
At a time when soldiers fought, and marched, and
lived in tight scarlet tunics, high stocks, trousers
tightly strapped over Wellington boots, and shakos<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>
which would now be looked on as certain death, Sir
Henry evolved the startling heresy that to get the
best work out of troops, and to enable them to
undertake great exertions, it was necessary that the
soldier should be loosely, comfortably, and suitably
clad, that something more substantial than a pill-box
with a pocket-handkerchief wrapped round it was
required as a protection from a tropical sun, and
that footgear must be made for marching, and not
for parading round a band-stand.</p>

<p>Martinets of the old school gravely shook their
heads, and trembled for the discipline of men
without stocks and overalls. Men of the Irregular
Cavalry, almost as much trussed and padded as
their Regular comrades (who were often so tightly
clad as to be unable to mount without assistance),
looked with good-natured tolerance on a foredoomed
failure. But Sir Henry Lawrence had the
courage of his opinions, and determined to put his
theories to practice, though at first on a small scale.</p>

<p>Not only were the Guides to be sensibly clothed,
but professionally also they were to mark a new
departure. In 1846 the Punjab was still a Sikh
province, and the administration was only thinly
strengthened by a sprinkling of British officers.
Men, half soldiers, half civilians, and known in
India under the curious misnomer of Political
Officers,&mdash;a class to whom the British Empire
owes an overwhelming debt&mdash;were scattered here
and there, hundreds of miles apart, and in the<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>
name of the Sikh Durbar practically ruled and
administered provinces as large as Ireland or
Scotland. The only British troops in the country
were a few of the Company's regiments, quartered
at Lahore to support the authority of the Resident,&mdash;a
mere coral island in the wide expanse.
What Sir Henry Lawrence felt was the want of
a thoroughly mobile body of troops, both horse
and foot, untrammelled by tradition, ready to move
at a moment's notice, and composed of men of
undoubted loyalty and devotion, troops who would
not only be of value in the rough and tumble of
a soldier's trade, but would grow used to the finer
arts of providing skilled intelligence.</p>

<p>The title selected for the corps was in itself a new
departure in the British Army, and history is not
clear as to whether its pre-ordained duties suggested
the designation to Sir Henry Lawrence, or whether,
in some back memory, its distinguished predecessor
in the French army stood sponsor for the idea.
Readers of the Napoleonic wars will remember that,
after the battle of Borghetto, the Great Captain
raised a <i>Corps des Guides</i>, and that this was the
first inception of the <i>Corps d'Elite</i>, which later grew
into the Consular Guard, and later still expanded
into the world-famed Imperial Guard ten thousand
strong.</p>

<p>But whatever the history of the inception of its
title, the duties of the Corps of Guides were clearly
and concisely defined in accordance with Sir Henry's<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>
precepts. It was to contain trustworthy men, who
could, at a moment's notice, act as guides to troops
in the field; men capable, too, of collecting trustworthy
intelligence beyond, as well as within, our
borders; and, in addition to all this, men, ready to
give and take hard blows, whether on the frontier
or in a wider field. A special rate of pay was
accorded to all ranks. And finally, fortunate as
Sir Henry Lawrence had been in the inspiration
that led him to advocate this new departure, he was
no less fortunate in his selection of the officer who
was destined to inaugurate a new feature in the
fighting forces of the Empire.</p>

<p>Even from among officers of proved experience
and ability it is by no means easy to select the
right man to inaugurate and carry through successfully
an experimental measure; much more difficult
is it to do so when the selection lies among young
officers who have still to win their spurs. Yet from
among old or young, experienced or inexperienced,
it would have been impossible to have selected an
officer with higher qualifications for the work in
hand than the young man on whom the choice fell.</p>

<p>Born of a soldier stock, and already experienced
in war, Harry Lumsden possessed all the finest attributes
of the young British officer. He was a man
of strong character, athletic, brave, resolute, cool and
resourceful in emergency; a man of rare ability
and natural aptitude for war, and possessed, moreover,
of that magnetic influence which communicates<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>
the highest confidence and devotion to those who
follow. In addition he was a genial comrade, a
keen sportsman, and a rare friend to all who knew
him. Such, then, was the young officer selected by
Sir Henry Lawrence to raise the Corps of Guides.</p>

<p>That the commencement should be not too
ambitious, it was ruled that the first nucleus should
consist only of one troop of cavalry and two
companies of infantry, with only one British officer.
But as this story will show, as time and success
hallowed its standards, this modest squad expanded
into the corps which now, with twenty-seven British
officers and fourteen hundred men, holds an
honoured place in the ranks of the Indian Army.</p>

<p>Following out the principle that the corps was to
be for service and not for show, the time-honoured
scarlet of the British Army was laid aside for the
dust-coloured uniform which half a century later,
under the now well-known name of <i>khaki</i>, became
the fighting dress of the whole of the land forces
of the Empire.</p>

<p>The spot chosen for raising the new corps was
Peshawur, then the extreme outpost of the British
position in India, situated in the land of men born
and bred to the fighting trade, free-lances ready to
take service wherever the rewards and spoils of war
were to be secured. While fully appreciating the
benefits of accurate drill, and the minute attention
to technical detail, bequeathed as a legacy by the
school of Wellington, Lumsden upheld the principle<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>
that the greatest and best school for war is war
itself. He believed in the elasticity which begets
individual self-confidence, and preferred a body of
men taught to act and fight with personal
intelligence to the highly-trained impersonality
which requires a sergeant's order before performing
the smallest duty, and an officer's fostering care to
forestall its every need.</p>

<p>Holding such views, it is with no surprise we read
that, while his men were still under the elementary
training of drill instructors borrowed from other
regiments, Lumsden led them forth to learn the
art of war under the blunt and rugged conditions
of the Indian frontier. To march, not through
peaceful lanes, but with all the care and precautions
which a semi-hostile region necessitated; to
encamp, not on the quiet village green where
sentry-go might appear an unmeaning farce, but in
close contact with a vigilant and active race of hard
fighters, especially skilled in the arts of surprises and
night-attacks; to be ready, always ready, with the
readiness of those who meet difficulties half way,&mdash;such
were the precepts which the hardy recruits of
the Guides imbibed simultaneously with the
automatic instruction of the drill-sergeant.</p>

<p>Nor was it long before Lumsden had an opportunity
of practically demonstrating to the young idea
his methods of making war. The corps, barely
seven months old, was encamped at K&agrave;lu Khan in
the plain of Yusafzai, when sudden orders came,<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>
directing it to make a night-march, with the object
of surprising and capturing the village of Mughdara
in the Panjtar Hills. In support of the small band of
Guides was sent a troop of Sikh cavalry, seasoned
warriors, to stiffen the young endeavour and hearten
the infant warrior. Marching all night, half an hour
before daylight the force arrived at the mouth of a
narrow defile, three-fourths of a mile long, leading
to the village, and along which only one horseman
could advance at a time. Nothing dismayed, and
led by the intrepid Lumsden, in single file the
Guides dashed at full gallop through the defile,
fell with fury on the awakening village, captured
and disarmed it, and brought away, as trophies
of war, its chief and three hundred head of
cattle. To add to the modest pride taken in this
bright initial feat of arms, it was achieved single-handed,
for the supporting troop of Sikhs failed to
face the dark terrors of the defile and remained
behind. This opening skirmish was the keynote to
many an after success. It helped to foster a spirit
of alert preparedness, readiness to seize the fleeting
opportunity, and courage and determination when
once committed to action. These seeds thus planted
grew to be some of the acknowledged attributes
of the force as it blossomed into maturity under
its gallant leader.</p>

<p>During the first year of its existence the young
corps was engaged in several more of the same
class of enterprise, and in all acquitted itself with<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>
quiet distinction. As, however, the history of one is
in most particulars that of another, it will not be
necessary to enter into a detailed account of each.</p>

<p>The British in the Peshawur Valley, as
elsewhere in the Punjab, were in a somewhat
peculiar position. They were not administering, or
policing, the country on behalf of the British Government,
but in the name of the Sikh Durbar. In the
Peshawur Valley, in which broad term may be
included the plains of Yusafzai, the Sikh rule was
but feebly maintained amidst a warlike race of an
antagonistic faith. In the matter of the collection
of revenue, therefore, the ordinary machinery of
government was not sufficiently strong to effect
regular and punctual payment; and consequently,
when any village or district was much in arrears, it
became customary to send a body of troops to collect
the revenue. If the case was merely one of dilatoriness,
unaccompanied by hostile intent, the case was
sufficiently met by the payment of the arrears due, and
by bearing the cost of feeding the troops while the
money was being collected. But more often, dealing
as they were with a weak and discredited government,
the hardy warriors of the frontier, sending
their wives and cattle to some safe glen in the
distant hills, openly defied both the tax-collector
and the troops that followed him. It then became
a case either of coercion or of leaving it alone.
An effete administration, like that of the Sikhs, if
thus roughly faced, as often as not let the matter<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>
rest. But with the infusion of British blood a new
era commenced; and the principle was insisted
on that, where revenue was due, the villagers must
pay or fight. And further, if they chose the latter
alternative, a heavy extra penalty would fall on
them, such as the confiscation of their cattle, the
destruction of their strongholds, and the losses
inevitable when the appeal is made to warlike
arbitration.</p>

<p>It was on such an expedition that one of the
Guides had a curious and fatal adventure. Colonel
George Lawrence, who was the British Representative
in Peshawur, was out in Yusafzai with a brigade
of Sikh troops, collecting revenue and generally
asserting the rights of government. Co-operating
with him was Lumsden with the Guides. Among
the recalcitrants was the village of Babuzai, situated
in a strong position in the Lundkwar Valley, and
Lawrence determined promptly to coerce it. His
plan of operation was to send the Guides' infantry
by night to work along the hills, so that before daylight
they would be occupying the commanding
heights behind the village, and thus cut off escape
into the mountains. He himself, at dawn, would be
in position with the Sikh brigade to attack from the
open plain; while the Guides' cavalry were disposed
so as to cut off the retreat to the right up the
valley.</p>

<p>In pursuance of their portion of the plan of
operations, as the Guides' infantry were cautiously<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>
moving along the hills towards their allotted position,
in the growing light they suddenly came upon a
picquet of the enemy placed to guard against this
very contingency. To fire was to give the alarm, so
with exceeding promptness the picquet was charged
with the bayonet, and overpowered. At the head
of the small storming party charged a <i>duffadar</i>[1] of
the Guides' cavalry, by name Fatteh Khan. Fatteh
Khan was one of those men to whom it was as the
breath of life to be in every brawl and fight within
a reasonable ride. On this occasion he was of
opinion that the cavalry would see little or no
fighting, whereas the infantry might well be in
for a pretty piece of hand-to-hand work. &quot;To
what purpose therefore, Sahib, should I waste
my day?&quot; he said to Lumsden. &quot;With your
Honour's permission I will accompany my infantry
comrades on foot. Are we not all of one corps?&quot;
And so he went, keeping well forward, and handy
for the first encounter.</p>

<div class="footnote">[1]<i>Duffadar</i>,
a native non-commissioned officer of cavalry, answering
to the <i>naik</i> (corporal) of infantry.</div>

<p>As the gallant duffadar, sword in hand, dashed at
the picquet, he was from a side position shot through
both arms; but not a whit dismayed or hindered he
hurled himself with splendid courage at the most
brawny opponent he could single out. A short
sharp conflict ensued, Fatteh Khan with his disabled
arm using his sword, while his opponent, with
an Affghan knife in one hand, was busy trying to<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
induce the glow on his matchlock to brighten up,
that the gun might definitely settle the issue. In
the course of the skirmishing between the two men
a curious accident, however, occurred. The tribesman,
as was usual in those days, was carrying under
his arm a goat-skin bag full of powder for future
use. In aiming a blow at him, Fatteh Khan missed
his man, but cut a hole in the bag; the powder
began to run out, and, as ill chance would have
it, some fell on the glowing ember of the matchlock.
This weapon, pointed anywhere and anyhow
at the moment, went off with a terrific report,
which was followed instantaneously by a still greater
explosion. The flame had caught the bag of
powder, and both the gallant duffadar and his
staunch opponent were blown to pieces.</p>

<p>So died a brave soldier. But lest the noise
should have betrayed them, his comrades hurried on
with increased eagerness, and as good fortune would
have it arrived in position at the very nick of time.
The operation was completely successful. In due
course the Sikhs attacked in front, and when the
enemy tried to escape up the hills behind their
village, they found retreat cut off by the Guides'
infantry. Turning back, they essayed to break
away to the right; but the intention being signalled
to the Guides' cavalry, who were placed so
as to intercept the fugitives, these fell with great
vigour on the tribesmen and gave them a much
needed lesson.  It was now no longer an effete Sikh<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
administration that breakers of the law had to deal
with, but the strong right arm and warlike guile of
the British officer, backed up by men who meant
fighting.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was now the spring of 1848, and great events
were brewing in the Punjab. It was the lull between
the two stormy gusts of the First and Second
Sikh Wars. To us at this date it does not seem to
require the omniscience of a prophet, prophesying
after the event, to discover that the settlement
arrived at after the First Sikh War contained most
of the possible elements of an unpermanent nature.
The Punjab was to remain a Sikh province, with the
infant son of the Lion of the Punjab as its Sovereign;
but the real ruler of the kingdom of the Sikhs
was a British officer, Henry Lawrence, at the head
of a council of regency. To support his authority
British bayonets overawed the capital of the
Punjab, and assumed the mien of those who hold
their place by right of conquest. Attached to,
but really at the head of, the minor centres of
administration, were men like Herbert Edwardes,
Abbott, Taylor, George Lawrence, Nicholson, and
Agnew; the stamp of high-souled pioneer who
though alone, unguarded, and hundreds of miles
from succour, by sheer force of character makes felt
the weight of British influence in favour of just and
cleanly government. And acting thus honourably
they were naturally detested by the lower class<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>
of venal rulers, whose idea of government was,
and is at all times and on all occasions, by persuasion,
force, or oppression, to squeeze dry the
people committed to their charge. Ready to the
hand of a discontented satrap, sighing for the
illicit gains of a less austere rule, were the bands
of discharged soldiers, their occupation gone, who
crowded every village. It was easy to show, as
was indeed the case, that these discontented
warriors owed their present plight to the hated
English. For while one of the conditions of peace,
after the First Sikh War, insisted on the disbandment
of the greater portion of the formidable Sikh
army, the enlightened expedient of enlisting our
late enemies into our own army had not yet been
acted upon to any great extent. To add to the
danger, every town and hamlet harboured the chiefs
and people of only a half-lost cause.</p>

<p>Thus the train of revolt was laid with an almost
fatal precision throughout the province, and only
required the smallest spark to set it alight. At the
head of the incendiary movement was the Maharani,
the wife of the late and mother of the present
infant king. Some inkling of the plot, as could
hardly fail, came to the British Resident's ears, the
primary step contemplated being to seduce from
their allegiance the Company's troops quartered at
Lahore.</p>

<p>It was at this stage that a summons reached
Lumsden to march with all despatch to Lahore, a<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
distance of two hundred and fifty miles. Here was
an opportunity of testing the value of a corps whose
loyalty was above question, and which from its
composition could have no sympathy with the
movement. Consequently to Lumsden and his
men was assigned the difficult and unaccustomed
duty of unravelling the plot and bringing the
conspirators to justice. Setting to work with his
accustomed readiness, and aided by one of his
<i>ressaldars</i>,[1] Fatteh Khan, Khuttuk, of whose prowess
on many a bloody field the story will in due course
be told, Lumsden with characteristic alacrity undertook
this intricate and dangerous duty. His tracks
covered, so to speak, by the unsuspicious bearing of
a blunt soldier in command of a corps of rugged
trans-border warriors, the unaccustomed r&ocirc;le of a
skilled detective was carried out with promptness
and success. In the course of a very few days
some of the Guides had obtained conclusive proof
regarding three matters: that the Maharani was
at the head of the movement, that her chief agent
was the Sikh general Khan Singh, and that the
Company's troops had already been tampered with.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>Ressaldar</i>, a native
commissioned officer of cavalry.</p></div>

<p>As the plot thickened it was discovered that a
meeting of the conspirators, including fifty or sixty
men of various regiments, was to take place on a
certain night at a certain place. Lumsden patiently
awaited the event, intending with the Guides to
surround and capture the conspirators red-handed.<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
But, on the night fixed for the meeting, a retainer
of General Khan Singh came to visit one of the
Guides, with whom he was on friendly terms, and
in the course of conversation made it evident that
his master was not easy in his mind, why not
no one could say, and that he had half determined
on flight. The man of the Guides, leaving
his friend in charge of a comrade, with commendable
acumen hastened to Lumsden and told
him the story. That officer at once saw that the
moment had come to strike, lest the prey escape.
He therefore immediately clapped the Sikh
general's retainer into the quarterguard, much
to that individual's astonishment, and promptly
parading the Guides, hurried down to the city and
surrounded Khan Singh's house.</p>

<p>It was now past eleven o'clock, the house was in
darkness and strongly barricaded all round; the city
was that of a foreign power, and no police, or other,
warrant did Lumsden hold. But he was no man to
stand on ceremony, or shirk responsibility, nor was
he one for a moment to count on the personal risks
he ran. Finding the doors stouter than they expected,
his men burst in a window, and headed
by their intrepid officer dashed into the building.
There, overcoming promptly any show of resistance,
they seized General Khan Singh, his <i>munshi</i>[1] and a
confidential agent, together with a box of papers,
and under close guard carried them back to the<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
Guides' camp. In due course the prisoners were
tried and conclusive evidence being furnished, and
confirmed by the incriminating documents found in
the box, General Khan Singh and his munshi were
sentenced to be hanged. This prompt dealing
served at once to check rebellion in the vicinity of
Lahore, and placed the Company's troops beyond
the schemes of conspirators.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>Munshi</i>, a secretary or clerk.</p></div>

<p>Amongst other papers found in Khan Singh's box
were some which clearly inculpated the Maharani,
and it was at once decided to deport her beyond the
region of effective intrigue. The lady was, under
arrangements made for her by the Government, at
this time residing in one of the late Maharaja's
palaces at Sheikapura about twenty-three miles from
Lahore. To Lumsden and his men was entrusted
the duty of arresting and deporting the firebrand
princess. As taking part in this mission, first
appears in the annals of the Guides the name of
Lieutenant W.S.R. Hodson, afterwards famous for
his many deeds of daring, and whose name still lives
as the intrepid and dashing leader of Hodson's
Horse. Appointed as adjutant and second-in-command
to a born exponent of sound, yet daring,
methods of warfare, his early training in the Guides
stood him in good stead in his brief, stirring, and
glorious career.</p>

<p>In the execution of their orders Lumsden and
Hodson with the Guides' cavalry set off quietly after
dark for their twenty-three miles ride. The service<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>
was of some difficulty and of no little danger, for
not only might the Maharani's numerous partisans
make an armed resistance, but failing this they
might organise a formidable rescue party to cut off
the enterprise between Sheikapura and the Ravi.
Against any such attempt, made with resources well
within hail, the slender troop of the Guides would
naturally come in for some rough buffeting. Much,
however, to the surprise, and possibly the relief,
of the British officers, they were received not only
without any signs of hostility, but with smiles of
well-assumed welcome. The explanation of this
was that somehow news of the fate of General
Khan Singh had already reached the Maharani,
and with Eastern diplomacy she was preparing to
trim her bark on the other tack. Even to the
suggestion that she should prepare to make a
journey she raised no objection; and it was only
when she found herself on the road to Ferozepore,
and learnt that her destination was Benares, that the
courtesy and dignity of a queen gave place to
torrents of scurrilous abuse and invective such as
the dialects of India are pre-eminently capable of
supplying.</p>

<h4>THE FIGHTING ROUND MOOLTAN AND AFTER</h4>


<p>These prompt measures, however, served only
a local and temporary purpose, effective but little
beyond striking distance of the troops stationed at
Lahore. The flame of unrest damped down here
had burst forth under a different banner at Mooltan,
where the Diwan Mulraj farmed the province under
treaty with the Sikhs. The Diwan himself was a
miserable personality, but carried away by the tide of
popular feeling, he became inextricably involved in
antagonism to the British cause by the cold-blooded
murder of Agnew and Anderson. These two
British officers, with the full consent and support of
the Sikh Durbar, had been sent to Mooltan on
special duty in connection with the voluntary abdication
of Mulraj, which had been accepted by his
suzeraine. The escort sent with the British officers
was a strong one, and, if loyal, perfectly competent
to deal with any disorders.  It consisted of fourteen
hundred Sikhs, a regiment of Gurkhas, seven
hundred cavalry, and six guns.<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></p>

<p>This seemingly formidable and carefully composed
body of troops proved, however, to be entirely
unreliable. Agnew and Anderson were, within a
few hours of their arrival at Mooltan, attacked and
severely wounded by fanatics, and no one raised
a hand to help them. Lying helpless and sorely
wounded in the temporary asylum which their
quarters afforded, they heard with dismay that
practically the whole of the escort on whom their
safety depended had gone over to the faction of
Mulraj, a faction which insisted on his remaining
in power, and which was strongly antagonistic to the
claims of British political influence. Alone amid
thousands, it remained only for these brave young
officers to offer up their lives on the altar of British
dominion.</p>

<p>Thus strongly committed to a line of action
which was far from according with his weak and
vacillating nature, Mulraj raised the standard of
revolt, and sending the fiery cross through the
country, called on all to join in expelling the hated
foreigner, and common enemy, from the Land of
the Five Rivers. The prospects of the cause
looked bright indeed. No organised body of
British troops lay nearer than Lahore, hundreds of
miles distant; the hot season had commenced, when
the movement of regular troops encounters almost
insuperable difficulties; the whole country was
smarting under the sense of recent severe but
hardly conclusive defeat; while hundreds of petty<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>
chiefs, and thousands of soldiers, were chafing under
the thinly disguised veil of foreign sovereignty.</p>

<p>Yet out of the unlooked for West arose a star
which in a few brief weeks eclipsed the rising moon
of national aspiration, and, shining bright and true,
helped to guide the frail bark of British supremacy
through victory to the haven of a permanent peace.
That star was an unknown British subaltern named
Herbert Edwardes. Edwardes was one of the
young officers deputed to assist the Sikhs in the
work of systemising and purifying their administration,
and was at this time engaged in the revenue
settlement of the Dera-Ismail-Khan district. One
day in June as he sat in court settling disputes, there
came to him a runner, covered with dust and sweat,
who brought to him a last message from Agnew,
as he lay wounded on his bed in Mooltan. The
message asked urgently for help, and appealed, as
the writer knew, to one who would spare no risk or
pains to furnish it. To succour the wounded British
officers was a matter which had passed beyond the
region of possibility, for the ink had hardly dried on
their message before they were murdered; but to
re-establish the prestige of the British name, to
reassert its dignity and influence, and to bring to
punishment the perpetrators of a hideous and
treacherous crime,&mdash;these tasks Herbert Edwardes
at once set before himself.</p>

<p>Alone, save for the presence of one other Englishman,
the young British subaltern, with the sage<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>
intrepidity of ripest experience, hastily summoned
the chiefs of the Derajat and Bannu districts to his
aid, and assembled their motley followings under his
banner. He sent messengers to the friendly chief
of Bhawulpore, and called on him to join in the
crusade against Mooltan. Then after much feinting
and fencing, and greatly assisted by the stout Van
Cortlandt, Edwardes threw his army across the
Indus, at this season a roaring torrent three miles
wide, and sought out his enemy. Coming up with
him he defeated Mulraj and his army of ten
thousand men in two pitched battles, and drove him
to take refuge behind the walls of Mooltan.</p>

<p>Accompanying Herbert Edwardes was a detachment
of the Guides, lent by Lumsden, and before the
war bent on learning their way about this portion of
the frontier, in accordance with the r&ocirc;le assigned
their corps. This detachment not only joined with
natural zest in the hard fighting that fell to the share
of all, but proved of great service to the commander
as scouts and intelligence men. So far did intrepidity
and love of adventure carry them, that four <i>sowars</i>,[1]
under Duffadar Khanan Khan, rode through the
enemy's outposts, and with admirable coolness
picketed their horses, probably without excessive
ostentation, amidst the enemy's cavalry. They then
separated, and went about to see and remember
that which might be useful to their own commander
and their own comrades in the war.  It is perhaps
needless to say that discovery meant instant<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>
death, yet, with the happy insolence of the born
free-lance, superb indifference carried them through
where the slightest slip would have been fatal.
Indeed, one of them, by name Mohaindin, with
nerves of steel, actually succeeded in being taken on
as an orderly by Diwan Mulraj himself, and while
acting as such was severely wounded by a round shot
from one of our own guns at the battle of Sadusam.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>Sowar</i>, a native trooper.</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile the headquarters of the Guides, under
Lumsden, were hastening down from Lahore to
give Edwardes that invaluable support which,
however meagre in numbers, stout hearts, whose
loyalty is above suspicion, afford to a harassed
commander. Joyfully were they welcomed, as one
sweltering day in June the Guides joined the little
force which was besieging an army of equal or
perhaps greater strength lying behind the growing
ramparts of Mooltan.</p>

<p>Nor were the new arrivals long in showing their
mettle. The camp was then pitched on the right
of the <i>nullah</i> at Suraj Kund, and in this position was
much annoyed by twelve pieces of ordnance, placed
in position round the Bibi Pakdaman mosque.
These Lumsden offered to capture and silence and,
if possible, bring away. The service was carried out
with much dash and gallantry, and the guns were
captured and rendered useless, though it was found
impossible, in face of the heavy odds, to bring them off.</p>

<p>But the siege of Mooltan, in so far as the Guides<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
were concerned, was chiefly memorable for bringing
prominently to notice the gallant and romantic figure
of Fatteh Khan, Khuttuk. This noble fellow was
one of those Bayards of the East who know no fear,
and as soldiers are without reproach. Born of a
fighting stock and fighting tribe, cradled amidst wars
and alarms, he developed the highest qualities of
a brave, resolute, and resourceful partisan leader.
Always ready, always alert, nothing could upset his
equanimity, nothing take him by surprise, while no
odds were too great for him to face. With the
true instinct of the cavalry leader he struck hard
and promptly, and upheld in person the doctrine
that boldness, even unto recklessness, should be the
watchword of the light cavalryman. Yet this paladin
of the fight could barely write his name. It is not
every soldier who has the opportunity nowadays, as
in the days of champions, to perform a historic deed
in the open with both armies as spectators. Yet
so it happened to Ressaldar Fatteh Khan one hot
day in August, 1848, before the walls of Mooltan.</p>

<p>Lumsden was absent on some duty; indeed, there
were only three British officers, and these took turn
and turn about in the trenches, when a messenger
galloped into the Guides' camp to report that a
marauding party of the enemy's cavalry, some twenty
strong, had driven off a herd of General Whish's
camels which were grazing near his camp.
Fatteh Khan, as ressaldar, was the senior
officer in camp, and at once gave the order for<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>
every man to boot and saddle and get to horse
at once. The little party, numbering barely seventy,
led by Fatteh Khan, followed the messenger at a
gallop for three miles to the scene of the raid.
Arrived there they suddenly found themselves confronted,
not by a marauding troop of horsemen
hastily driving off a herd of camels, but by the whole
force of the enemy's cavalry, some twelve hundred
strong. These veteran swordsmen and lancers, of
whose skill and bravery in battle we had had ample
proof during this and previous wars, had been sent
out to intercept a convoy of treasure expected in
the British camp. Having, however, failed in their
mission, they were leisurely returning to Mooltan,
when a little cloud appeared on their fighting horizon.
Some returning patrol, no doubt, they thought,
some frightened stragglers driven in perhaps, some
stampeding mules or ponies. But no! the little cloud
now discloses a little line of horsemen, tearing along
as if the devil drove. The whole mass of cavalry,
like startled deer, halted and stared at this reckless
onslaught; and while thus standing, transfixed with
astonishment, Fatteh Khan and his gallant troop of
Guides were on them.</p>

width="373" height="544" /></div>

<p>Yelling fiercely, with lance and sword the Guides
clove their way through the huddling mass of the
enemy. Then clearing, they wheeled about, and with
unabated fury fell again upon the benumbed and paralysed
foe. Not yet content, the heroic Khuttuk again
called on his men for another effort, and, rallying<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>
and wheeling about, the weary troopers and still
wearier horses once more rode down into the
stricken mass. But &quot;God preserve us from these
fiends,&quot; muttered the demoralised Sikhs, and, assisting
their deity to answer the pious prayer, the whole
mass broke and fled, pursued up to the very walls
of Mooltan by &quot;that thrice accursed son of perdition,
Fatteh Khan, Khuttuk,&quot; and the remnants of
his seventy Guides.</p>

<p>Through the intense heat of the summer of 1848
the little cluster of English officers who stood for
British dominion kept heart and energy in the siege
of Mooltan. As Edwardes described the position,
it was only a terrier watching a tiger; but it was at
any rate a good stout-hearted English terrier, and
the tiger was afraid to face it. Yet even this stout
terrier had to give way a little, when no reinforcements
arrived, and when, in September, Sher Sing,
with three thousand four hundred cavalry and nine
hundred infantry, deserted and went over to the
enemy.</p>

<p>The siege, however, was only temporarily raised,
and was at once resumed on the arrival of a column of
Bombay troops. This reinforcement consisted of two
British infantry regiments, five Native infantry
regiments, and three regiments of Native cavalry.
With his force thus strengthened General Whish
immediately resumed the offensive, and not only
renewed the siege, but determined to take the place
by assault.  In the furtherance of this project he<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
first stormed and captured the city, many of the
buildings in which completely dominated the fort
at short effective ranges. From the coigns of
vantage thus gained the British artillery and infantry
poured a hail of shot and shell into the doomed
defences, while the cavalry hovered outside ready
to pounce on those who broke cover. Placed in
these desperate straits, and without hope of succour,
Diwan Mulraj and the whole of his force surrendered
unconditionally on the 22nd of January, 1849, after
a siege which had lasted nearly seven months.</p>

<p>This timely success released at a critical moment,
for service elsewhere, the British forces engaged in
the siege. For meanwhile great events had been
happening in the upper Punjab, and great were yet
to come. On January 13th had been fought the
bloody battle of Chillianwalla, where the casualties
on both sides were very severe, and where the
gallant 24th Foot had thirteen officers and the
sergeant-major laid out dead on their mess-table.
Lord Gough required nearly three thousand men to fill
the gaps in his ranks before again closing with the
redoubtable Sikhs. On every count, therefore, the
news of the fall of Mooltan was received with
considerable satisfaction, and the troops recently
engaged in it with keen alacrity turned their faces
northwards to Lord Gough's assistance, in the hope
of arriving in time to throw their weight into the
balance in the closing scenes of a campaign destined
to add a kingdom to the British Empire.<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></p>

<p>Ahead of the troops from Mooltan went
Lumsden and the Guides' cavalry, followed by
Hodson with the Guides' infantry. The corps
when re-united, before it joined Lord Gough, was
deflected for the performance of a detached duty
which brought it no little honour. It was reported
that considerable numbers of Sikh troops, under
Ganda Singh and Ram Singh, having crossed the
Chenab, were moving south-east heavily laden with
spoil, which having disposed of, they would be free
to fall on the British lines of communication.</p>

<p>Starting in hot haste, Lumsden and Hodson took
up the trail, and by dogged and relentless pursuit,
after three days and nights of incessant marching,
came up with their quarry. They found Ganda
Singh and his following at Nuroat on the Beas
River, while Ram Singh was some miles further
on.</p>

<p>The position taken up by Ganda Singh was in a
clump of mango trees, surrounded by a square ditch
and bank in place of a hedge, as is often the case
in the East. This formed a good natural defence,
and piling their spoil up amongst the trees, Ganda
Singh prepared to fight desperately to hold what
they had won with so much toil. The right of the Sikh
position rested on a deep and tortuous nullah, or dry
watercourse, whose precipitous sides, if properly
watched, formed an excellent flank defence; but if
unwatched they formed an equally admirable covered
approach whereby an opponent might penetrate or<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>
turn the position. The manifest precaution of
setting a watch was, however, neglected, an error not
likely to slip the attention of so skilled a campaigner
as Lumsden. Occupying, therefore, the attention
of the enemy in front by preparations for the
infantry attack under Hodson, Lumsden himself,
with the cavalry, slipped into the nullah, and working
quietly past the enemy's flank emerged on to his
rear at a spot where a friendly clump of sugar-cane
afforded further concealment till the appointed moment.
A signal was now made for Hodson to attack
vigorously in front, which he accordingly did, and
after severe fighting drove the enemy into the open.
Seizing the auspicious moment, Lumsden issued
from his shelter, and falling like a whirlwind on the
retiring enemy, literally swept them from the face of
the earth; one man only escaped to tell the tale.
Amongst the recovered loot were found the silver
kettle-drums of the 2nd Irregular Cavalry lost in the
recent fighting, and amongst the slain was Ganda
Singh. General Wheler coming up on the following
day, the combined force crossed the Beas, attacked,
and utterly routed Ram Singh, who was occupying
a strong position behind that river.</p>

<p>These services performed the Guides turned back,
and hastening northwards arrived in the camp of
the Grand Army in time to take part in the crowning
and decisive victory of Gujrat. The battle,
according to history, was chiefly an artillery duel, the
preponderance and accuracy of our fire paving the way<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>
for a practically unchecked advance of the infantry.
The Guides, therefore, did not see much fighting
during the battle; but their turn came that night,
when, attached to Gilbert's cavalry division, they
joined in the strenuous pursuit of the Sikhs,&mdash;a
pursuit which began on the battle-field and ended at
the rocky gates of the Khyber two hundred miles
away. The first burst carried the pursuing squadrons
past the battle-field of Chillianwalla, across the
Jhelum river, capturing on the way all the Sikh
guns that had escaped from the battle-field. Snatching
a few hours' rest, Gilbert's fine horsemen
were again in the saddle, and with relentless fury
hunted the demoralised enemy, allowing him not
a moment's respite, not an hour to steady his
flight or turn to bay. Right through the bright
winter days, through a country of rocks and ravines,
pressed on the avenging squadrons; till, utterly
worn out, starving, with ammunition failing, a
dejected and exhausted majority laid down their
arms and surrendered unconditionally at Rawul
Pindi. But the Affghan Horse in the service of the
Sikhs fled still further north, hoping to escape to
their own country, and in hot pursuit of these went
the Guides, a stern stiff ride of close on a hundred
miles; and running them staunchly to the end,
they drove the sorry remnants across the Affghan
border.</p>

<p>Thus brilliantly concluded the second Sikh War,
which, after many anxious moments and much hard<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>
fighting, resulted in adding to the Queen's domains
a kingdom larger than France or Germany and
more populous than Italy or Spain; and herein is
recorded the modest share taken by the Guides in
these great events.</p>

<h4>THE CAPTURE OF THE FORT OF GORINDGHAR</h4>


<p>A Traveller who at this day passes Amritsar by
train will, if he looks to the south, see hard by the
formidable fortress of Gorindghar. Over its battlements
now floats the Union Jack, and on its drawbridge
may be seen the familiar red coat of the
British sentry. Should he ever pass that fort
again, he may perhaps regard it with greater
interest after reading the stirring tale of how it
was captured from the Sikhs by a handful of resolute
men of the Guides. To tell this story we must
be forgiven for forsaking strict chronology; for the
incident here narrated took place while part of
the corps was still engaged at the siege of Mooltan.</p>

<p>Against modern artillery the fort of Gorindghar
would be of little avail, however gallantly held; but
by the standard of 1848 it was a very powerful
work. Its armament consisted of no less than eighteen
guns, while fifty-two lay stored in reserve, and its
garrison consisted of such veteran fighters as a regiment
of Sikh infantry. As may readily be under<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>stood,
without touching on strategical details, it was a
matter of considerable importance that this fort, lying
as it did on the main line of the British communications
between Umballa and Lahore, should not remain
in hostile hands. It was therefore resolved to send
back from Lahore a force to capture if possible, but
at any rate to mask, this formidable work. To
accomplish this, a considerable force was despatched
from Lahore, and in advance of it was sent a
party to reconnoitre and gain intelligence. This
party consisted of <i>Subadar</i>[1] Rasul Khan, and one
hundred and forty of all ranks of the Guides'
infantry, with orders to get along as fast as they
could. At noon, therefore, on a hot September
day the little party set off on their forty mile march
along the dusty, treeless road to Amritsar.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>Subadar</i>, a native commissioned officer commanding a company
of infantry.</p></div>

<p>Marching all that day, and the greater part of the
following night, Rasul Khan arrived in the vicinity
of the fort just as day was breaking. His orders
were to reconnoitre and find out in what state
of preparedness the garrison stood, what was its
strength in men and guns, the best means of attack,
and the most vulnerable quarter. To gain all this
useful information the most obviously complete
method was to get inside the fort itself, and this
the resourceful subadar determined to do.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that at this time the
second Sikh war was in full swing, and that<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>
various bands of troops who had espoused
the Sikh cause were roaming the country. The
British forces, on the other hand, consisted chiefly of
drilled and organised regiments, armed, equipped,
and clothed on a regular basis, and recognisable as
such. The Guides, however, newly raised, and
living a rough and ready adventurous life in their
ragged and war-worn khaki, bore little resemblance
to these, and might to a casual observer come from
anywhere, and belong to either side.</p>

<p>Rasul Khan was quick to perceive this point in his
favour, and take full advantage of it; for during the
long and weary night march, he had thought out his
plan. Taking three of his own men, stripping off
what uniform they had, and concealing their arms,
he had them securely bound and placed under a
heavy guard of their own comrades. As soon as it
was broad daylight, closely guarding his prisoners,
Rasul Khan marched boldly up to the main gate of
the fort, and was hailed by the Sikh sentry:
&quot;Halt there! who are you and what is your business?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After an exceedingly arduous pursuit, as you
may judge from our dusty and exhausted condition,&quot;
replied Rasul Khan, &quot;we have managed to capture
three most important prisoners, on whose heads a
high price has been placed by the Sikh Durbar.
They are the most desperate ruffians, full of the wiles
of Satan, and we greatly fear lest they should escape
us.  I and my troops are weary, and to guard them<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>
in the open requires so many men. Of your kindness
ask your Commandant if, in the Maharaja's
name, I may place them in your guard-room cells
until we march on again.&quot;</p>

<p>The Sikh sentry called the <i>havildar</i>[1] of the guard,
who in turn called the Commandant, and after much
palavering and cross questioning, the drawbridge
was let down and the party admitted. The remainder
of the Guides bivouacked here and there under the
shade of the fort walls, cooked their food, and lay
about at seeming rest, but all the while as alert and
wide-awake as their extremely hazardous position
required.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>Havildar</i>, a native non-commissioned officer of infantry, corresponding
to a sergeant.</p></div>

<p>The guard-room cells were pointed out to Rasul
Khan, the prisoners thrust into them, and the escort
quietly but firmly invited to rejoin their comrades
outside the walls; for in time of war, as the Commandant
explained, it behoves every man, especially
when the safety of a great fort is concerned, to walk
warily, and treat the stranger with circumspection.
So far, beyond seeing the main entrance and the
guard-room cells, Rasul Khan had not done much
towards securing that full information about the fort,
its garrison, and its defences, which it was of such
vital importance to gain. He had, however, secured
a footing, and, while with apparent readiness
he prepared to rejoin his men outside, he politely<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>
insisted that he must leave his own sentry to guard
the prisoners; &quot;for,&quot; as he jocularly remarked to
the Commandant, &quot;if I don't, you will be saying that
you captured these villains, and, sending them off to
Lahore, will secure the reward my men have earned!&quot;
The Commandant laughed heartily at this blunt
pleasantry, and partly out of good nature, and partly
to avoid all blame should the prisoners escape,
agreed to the proposal of the diplomatic subadar.
During the course of the day the utmost cordiality
was maintained, the Sikhs coming out and freely
fraternising with the Guides, who, in their casual
wanderings round, had at any rate got hold of a
fairly shrewd notion of what the outside of the fort
was like. But this was not enough for Rasul Khan,
and he laid his further plans accordingly.</p>

<p>The cordial interchange of rough soldierly
amenities had borne its fruit, and the suspicions of the
Sikhs were completely lulled. To an alert and
resourceful soldier like Rasul Khan, a man whom
nothing in warlike strategy escaped, it occurred
amongst other things that only a single sentry with
his reliefs, under a non-commissioned officer, guarded
the main entrance. As night fell, with engaging
candour he pointed out the weakness of this arrangement
to the Commandant, and, to avoid imposing
additional guard duties on the Sikh garrison, offered,
now that his men were well rested, to place a double
sentry on the cells of the prisoners. Further,
he made the obvious suggestion that it would
be unsound, when once the drawbridge was up, to<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>
let it down each time that a relief of sentries was
required, and that therefore it would probably be
more convenient for all parties, as well as safer, if
the reliefs for the double sentry also slept in the
fort. With a whole regiment in garrison there seemed
to be no particular objection to this proposal, and it
was therefore accepted. Rasul Khan thus had at
the main gate six men and a non-commissioned
officer, not to mention three soldiers disguised as
prisoners, as against three Sikhs and a non-commissioned
officer. Be assured that he chose the bravest
of the brave for that night's work, for, when the
drawbridge was drawn slowly up that evening, it
was ten men, and three of them unarmed, against
a regiment; and short and terrible would have been
the shrift accorded to them had an inkling of
suspicion arisen, or had the slightest blunder, or
precipitation, exposed the true position.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the force of cavalry and infantry sent
by the British Resident was hastening down from
Lahore, and Rasul Khan calculated that it would
arrive at streak of dawn next morning. He
despatched therefore two or three of his men to
meet the column, to apprise the commanding officer
of the state of affairs, urging him to make all haste
and giving him as full information as possible should
he on his arrival find that during the night disaster
had fallen on the staunch little band of Guides.
&quot;On the other hand,&quot; the message concluded, &quot;if by<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>
the Grace of God my plans prevail, I shall be ready
to welcome your Honour at the fort gates at
dawn.&quot;</p>

<p>To the party inside the fort the subadar's orders
were to keep a very desultory watch over the prisoners,
thus by example discouraging any undue vigilance
on the part of the Sikh sentry; and for the rest to
await quietly their opportunity till near dawn of day.
This they did, and when the appointed hour had
arrived the double sentry of the Guides fell like the
upper millstone on that heedless Sikh sentry, and
hewed him to the ground; at the same moment
the rest of the guard was silently overpowered,
gagged, and bound. Then, arming the three prisoners
with the captured weapons, the Guides' sentries
quickly and quietly lowered the drawbridge and let
in the whole company of their comrades. Thus
collected inside, with fixed bayonets, the cavalier,
which commanded the whole of the interior of the
work, was captured; the rest was easy, and the Sikhs,
out-man[oe]uvred and placed at great disadvantage,
surrendered at discretion. It is not always that
the best laid plans succeed without a hitch, but
the fortune of war was on this occasion entirely
kind to the British cause, and the bold game played
by subadar Rasul Khan and his men reaped a
splendid reward; the capture of a formidable fortress,
seventy guns, and a regiment of infantry, with little
or no loss.</p>

<p>When, as dawn grew stronger, the British commander
strained his anxious eyes towards the fort,<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>
to his immense relief friendly signals welcomed him,
and as the sun rose the gentle breeze flung to the
dusty haze the Union Jack, which ever since that
day has floated from the ramparts of the fort of
Gorindghar at Amritsar.</p>

<p>It may not be without interest, as illustrating the
liberality with which soldiers in those days were
treated, to mention that, besides the official thanks
of the British Government, Rasul Khan received a
robe of honour, a gun, a brace of pistols, and five
hundred rupees, each havildar and naik fifty rupees,
and each sepoy, including the &quot;prisoners,&quot; eleven
rupees. Nor may it be inappropriate to mention that
Rasul Khan was a brother of that same ressaldar
Fatteh Khan, who only the month before with a
handful of the Guides' cavalry had scattered as chaff
before the wind the flower of Diwan Mulraj's horsemen,
and chased them into the gates of Mooltan.</p>

<h4>ON THE FRONTIER IN THE 'FIFTIES.</h4>


<p>The Guides were now two years old, and, as an
outward and visible sign that they had won their
spurs, they were by the orders of the Government
considerably augmented. Hitherto with one troop
and two companies they had established an honoured
record; they were now raised to three troops of
cavalry and six companies of infantry.</p>

<p>To the general historian, who can of necessity deal
only with great events, peace reigned in India from
the conclusion of the Sikh Wars to the outbreak of
the Mutiny; but there was no peace for the Guides
during those eight years. Their history is full of
hardy adventure, of forced marches, and night
attacks; of the wiles of the border free-lance, met
and overcome with equal strategy and greater skill;
of brave deeds and splendid devotion. The conscientious
scribe is tempted to enlarge on each
and all of these; but perhaps our purpose in
giving the story of the Guides will be well enough<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>
served if we content ourselves with taking only two
or three of these exploits, thus hoping to throw
some light on the life led by a regiment on the
Indian frontier in those rough days.</p>

<p>Dipping haphazard into the ancient records, we
chance again on our old and gallant friend Fatteh
Khan, Khuttuk; and once again we find him a man
not easily taken aback in a sudden emergency. It was
towards the end of 1851 that the British Government,
having undertaken the surveying and mapping out
of the Peshawur Valley and Yusafzai, deputed Mr.
James, of the Survey Department, to superintend a
portion of the work. For his protection during this
duty, amongst a people fanatically opposed to anything
in the shape of a map or a survey, a
party of thirty of the Guides' cavalry was detailed
under Ressaldar Fatteh Khan. This detachment
was ordered to meet Mr. James at a small village
named Gujar Garhi, about two miles from Mardan.
Here, therefore, Fatteh Khan encamped to await
the Sahib's arrival; but the day passed, the night
fell, and still there were no signs of him. Thinking
that there must have been some mistake in the
dates, all turned in, and the camp was soon wrapped
in slumber, the silence disturbed only by the stamping
and roaring of the stallions at their standings,
and by the crisp alert call of the sentries as they
challenged.</p>

<p>It was past midnight, when a sharp-eyed Pathan
sentry espied mistily through the darkness what<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>
looked like a large body of mounted men approaching.
Instantly a sharp peremptory challenge rang
out: &quot;Halt! Who goes there?&quot; Equally promptly
floated back the answering watchword, &quot;Friend.&quot;
&quot;What friend?&quot; the sentry shouted, suspicious
still. &quot;Sahib,&quot; came back the disarming reply.
Whereupon the sentry, coming to the not unnatural
conclusion that the long-expected Sahib had at
last arrived, and that he saw before him Mr. James
with a large escort, sloped his sword, and gave the
usual right of way: &quot;Pass friend,&mdash;all's well.&quot;</p>

<p>At this moment Fatteh Khan awoke, and hearing
the word <i>sahib</i>, jumped up, ran out of his tent,
and hastened down to the end of the camp to
meet the Sahib. He had, however, no sooner
arrived there, than he at once noticed that the
advancing horsemen were armed with matchlocks.
Now our own cavalry in those days carried swords
and lances, but not firearms, therefore these midnight
visitors could not belong to any regiments in
our service. To a man like Fatteh Khan, born to
wars and alarms, who takes little for granted in
daylight and nothing at night, this was sufficient
to place him on his guard. With instant presence
of mind he shouted, in a voice to be heard throughout
the camp: &quot;Rouse up everyone! Draw swords!
The enemy are upon us!&quot;</p>

<p>Scarcely had he ceased speaking when the enemy,
throwing off further disguise, gave a yell and dashed
at the camp, firing heavily as they rode.  But<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>
though taken at a great disadvantage, and with odds
of seven to one against them, the Guides made shift
to be ready for the onslaught. There was naturally
no time to get to horse, or into any regular formation,
and therefore the attack had to be met on foot
with sword and lance, in some hasty serviceable
formation. Fatteh Khan therefore shouted to all
the non-commissioned officers, who carried lances,
to dash to the front and hold the outskirts of the
camp, while the rank and file who were armed with
swords should fall into knots of five or six, and
prepare to defend themselves.</p>

<p>Against this hardy improvised defence the fierce
attacks spent themselves like stormy waves against
outstanding rocks; yet as a proof of the heavy
fire, no tent escaped with less than ten or twelve
bullet-holes. When once, however, the first fusillade
was over, matters were on a somewhat more equal
basis, for a matchlock cannot be reloaded on horseback;
yet the odds were still great, and it took the
Guides all their time to hold their own. But the
surprise, as a surprise, having failed, the Swati
cavalry, finding so stout a resistance, began to
weaken in their endeavour. Catching the tide on
the turn, the Guides dashed forth, and became
themselves the attackers, hamstringing the horses,
and so hewing, cutting, and thrusting, that, finding
this no pigeons' nest, but rather a swarm of angry
hornets, the whole two hundred horsemen scattered
and fled.<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></p>

<p>The loss of the Guides in this staunch little affair
proved, when all was over, to have been altogether
insignificant; while the enemy on their part, besides
leaving many dead men and horses in camp, carried
off also, as was afterwards ascertained, a goodly
number who would never throw a leg over a horse
again. The leader of the attack was the redoubtable
Mukaram Khan, one of the most daring and notable
free-lances on the border.</p>

<p>In consequence of this and other raids it was
determined to take measures, on a considerable scale,
to discourage further efforts on the part of the border
tribes. Consequently a brigade of all arms, under
Sir Colin Campbell, moved out from Peshawur,
to punish the lawless, and to exact retribution
from those who had erred from the strict path of
peace.</p>

<p>Amongst the various strongholds that were on the
black list, and which, unless they surrendered at
discretion, were destined to be attacked, captured,
and sacked, was the Utmankheyl fortified village of
Nawadand. Opposite this the British force sat
down with the studied deliberation of old-time warfare,
when contending armies might encamp for weeks
and months within a stone's throw of each other.
During this dignified pause, while doubtless supplies
were being collected, and negotiations proceeding
with the enemy, the British outpost line lay in full
view of, and only &quot;one shout's distance,&quot; as the
Pathans expressively call it, from the enemy. And<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>
outside the line of infantry outposts lay a cavalry
picket of twenty men of the Guides.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that one fine morning, in the
month of May, 1852, the enemy, whether with intent
to surprise, or merely fired with the nervous irritation
of one who can no longer stand the strain of awaiting
an impending blow, determined to hasten the
issue by taking the offensive. So collecting his
rough and ragged legions, stout of heart and stout of
arm, carrying weapons not meanly to be compared
with our own, the outlaw chief, Ajun Khan, marched
out to attack the British, and to take them unawares
in their tents.</p>

<p>The movement was at once reported by the
British outposts, but troops take some few minutes
to arm, equip, and form up in line of battle; while
the Affghan border warrior moves with a swiftness
that may well cause panic and dismay. A young
subaltern of the Guides, Lieutenant G.N. Hardinge,
seeing how matters were trending, rode out to the
outlying picket of the Guides' cavalry, and there
took his stand. It was an anxious moment. Behind
him was the hastily arming camp, humming with the
bustle of preparation; and before him, advancing
across the stony plain, moved a line of skirmishers
backed up by closed supports, and followed by great
hordes of shouting warriors.</p>

<p>The motionless troop of the Guides stood foremost
to meet the shock. On came the hardy tribesmen<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>
swiftly and relentlessly; but still, as he looked
anxiously back, it was plain to the British subaltern
that his comrades were not yet armed to meet the
coming storm. &quot;We can only give them one
minute more,&quot; he said, and stout and steady
came the answer: &quot;Yes, your Honour, one minute
more.&quot; And as they spoke each stalwart trooper
gripped his sword still tighter and, shortening
his reins, laid the flat of his thigh hard on his wiry
neighing stallion; for as of old, so now, the war-horse
scented the battle from afar.</p>

<p>The time passed very slowly, a minute seeming
an eternity to the impatient soldiers. Fifteen
seconds&mdash;twenty seconds&mdash;thirty seconds&mdash;for&mdash;ty-five
seconds&mdash;six&mdash;ty!</p>

<p>&quot;Carry swords,&quot; in a serene and conversational
voice remarked the young subaltern; equally
smoothly and quietly came the order, &quot;Walk,
march.&quot; Then, as the troop moved forward,
followed the slightly more animated command,
&quot;Trot&quot;; and as the excitement of coming conflict
coursed with the wild exuberance of youth through
the boy's veins, &quot;Gallop! Charge!&quot; he yelled, and
back came an answering shout, &quot;Fear not, Sahib, we
are with you!&quot; And thus was launched on the
flood of death a little band of heroes, that they
might save an army.</p>

<p>But ever since the day when David slew Goliath, the
God of Battles has not always sided with the big battalions.
A few staunch hearts hurled fearlessly at the
foe may still, like the ancient slinger's stone, lay low<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>
the giant. So on this occasion the effect of the bold
attack was magical. Through the thin line of
skirmishers, heedless of the spluttering fire, went the
troop, like a round shot through a paper screen,
and fell like yelling furies on the clumps of swordsmen,
pikemen, and any-weapon-men, who formed
the supports. These they killed and wounded and
scattered like chaff to the wind. And then,&mdash;their
mission was accomplished! The enemy's advancing
masses wavered, halted, hesitation and dismay replacing
the confident sling-trot of a few minutes before.
The surprise had failed, the camp was saved.
Then Hardinge, his work accomplished, himself sore
wounded, the enemy's standard in his hands, rallied
his pursuing troop, and clearing to a flank left displayed
the British force drawn up and ready to
receive all comers.</p>

<p>To see the right moment and to seize it, to
balance the profit and loss, counting one's own life
as a feather in the scales, to strike hard and bold
whatever the odds,&mdash;such are a few simple soldier
lessons, learnt not from the scribes, but from a
gallant British subaltern.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>While Lieutenant Lumsden was in England in
1853 the command of the Guides was given to
Lieutenant W.S.R. Hodson. This book would
not be complete without relating the story of at any
rate one of the many occasions on which this gallant
officer, afterwards so famous, showed his fine metal.<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>
The fight about to be described was one, too, in
which the many brave and devoted officers who
have been surgeons to the corps have displayed the
greatest gallantry.</p>

<p>For high crimes and misdemeanours it was
decided to punish the large and important cluster
of villages named Bori, in the land of the Jowaki
Afridis, not far from the present military station
of Cherat. A brigade of all arms, consisting of the
22nd Foot, 20th Punjab Infantry, 66th Gurkhas (now
the 1st Gurkha Rifles), the Corps of Guides, a
squadron of Irregular Cavalry, some 9-pounder guns
on elephants, and a company of Sappers, the whole
under Colonel S.B. Boileau, was detailed for the
undertaking. The Bori villages lay in the valley of
the same name enclosed by high and rugged
mountains, making both ingress and egress in
face of practised mountaineers a most difficult
operation.</p>

<p>The advance was led by the Guides, who, themselves
active as panthers in the hills, drove the
Afridis before them through the Bori villages and
up the precipitous mountains behind. The main
body then set to work to burn and destroy the
villages with all the food and fodder therein, and to
drive off the cattle. So far, as is often the case in
fighting these mountaineers, all had gone well; but
now came the crucial time. Afridis may be driven all
day like mountain sheep, but when the night begins to
fall, and their tired pursuers commence of necessity<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>
to draw back to lower levels for food and rest, then
this redoubtable foe rises in all his strength, and with
sword and gun and huge boulder hurls himself like
a demon on his retiring enemy.</p>

<p>At one of the furthest points ahead was Lieutenant
F. McC. Turner, who with about thirty men of the
Guides had driven a very much superior force of
the enemy into a stone breastwork at the top of a
high peak. Here the British officer was held; not
an inch could he advance; and now he was
called upon to conform with the general movement
for retirement. To retire, placed as he was, meant
practical annihilation, so sticking to the rocks like
a limpet he blew a bugle calling for reinforcement.
Hodson, who himself was faced by great odds,
seeing the serious position of his friend, sent across
all the men he could afford to extricate him, but these
were not strong enough to effect their purpose.
Then it was that Dr. R. Lyell, the surgeon of the
Guides, took on himself to carry forward the much
needed succour. In reserve lying near him was
the Gurkha company of the Guides, and also a
company of the 66th Gurkhas under a native officer.
Taking these troops, with great dash and personal
gallantry he led them to the attack, drove back the
already exulting enemy, stormed their position, and
extricated Lieutenant Turner and his party from
their perilous position. It was a noble deed, nobly
and gallantly carried out; and when it had been
achieved, the brave fighter returned to the tender<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
care of the wounded, and to alleviate the pains
of the dying.</p>

<p>And now Hodson had got together the threads of
his retirement, and using one to help the other,
gradually and slowly drew back, covering the
brigade with a net of safety. Thus quietly falling
back, and meeting wild charges with ball and
bayonet, he kept the open valley till all the force
had safely passed the defile of exit. Then, while
the last of his infantry got safely to commanding
posts on the lower slopes, he himself, with the
ready resource of the born fighter, changed his
game, and from the patient r&ocirc;le of the steady
infantry commander, became a cavalry leader.
Mounting his horse and calling on the Guides'
cavalry to follow him, he suddenly charged the
astonished enemy, and hurling them back with
slaughter secured for the rest of his men a peaceful
retirement. But before they laid themselves on the
hard ground, this paladin of the fight and his
staunch warriors had spent eighteen hours in desperate
warfare with little food and no water.</p>

<p>So far as the records show this was the first
occasion on which Hodson had led a cavalry
charge, and was an auspicious opening to a cavalry
career of remarkable brilliancy,&mdash;a career which was
brought to a brave, but untimely end, only four
years later before the walls of Lucknow.</p>

<p>Amongst other historic figures who watched this
fight, and who added their generous meed of praise,<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
were John Lawrence, the saviour of the Punjab,
who later, as Lord Lawrence, was Viceroy of India,
Major Herbert Edwardes, now Commissioner of
Peshawur, who as a subaltern had won two pitched
battles before Mooltan, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Robert Napier, afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala
and Commander-in-Chief of the Army in India.</p>

<h4>THE STORY OF DIL&#256;WUR KHAN.</h4>


<p>The story of Dil&#257;wur Khan, subadar of the
Guides, is one which kindles many a kindly memory
of the rough brave fellows who, under a sprinkling of
English officers, upheld British supremacy on
the North-West Frontier of India in the early
'fifties.</p>

<p>When Lumsden was raising the Guides he looked
about for men who, as he expressed it, were &quot;accustomed
to look after themselves and not easily taken
aback by any sudden emergency,&quot;&mdash;men born and
bred to the sword, who had faced death a hundred
times from childhood upwards, and who had thus
instinctively learnt to be alert, brave, and self-reliant.
To these hardy warriors Lumsden explained the
simple doctrine that they were enlisted for three
years, had to do what they were bid, and would
receive a certain fixed salary every month for their
trouble.</p>

<p>Soldiers of fortune and dashing young bloods from
all the countryside flocked to his standard, and so<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>
popular was the corps that there were sometimes as
many as thirty of these receiving no pay, and
maintaining themselves and their horses, while awaiting
a vacancy. And great indeed was the excitement
when Lumsden, in his bluff breezy way, would say:
&quot;Well, here's a vacancy, and I don't for the life of
me know which of you to give it to. Come along
down to the rifle-range, and shoot it off amongst
yourselves; the best shot gets the vacancy.&quot; And
off they would go to the range, with all their
friends and relations to the fifth generation, and all
the partisans in the corps of each competitor: shooting
for the King's Prize at Bisley is a flat and tame
proceeding in comparison with this. And as each
shot was fired the friends of the competitor would
yell: &quot;<i>Sh&#257;hb&#257;sh</i>! Bravo! Well shot! Another bull's
eye! You will win for certain.&quot; While rival
interests would with equal emphasis discredit the
performance: &quot;This bull's eye was certainly an
accident. God willing he will miss next time.
Bravo! let us not lose heart!&quot;</p>

<p>The demeanour of the winner on such occasions
would make a Master in Lunacy look grave. The
happy young fellow would jump into the air, yelling
and pirouetting, brandishing a sword, and at
frequent intervals letting off a gun, nominally into the
air, while most of his friends did likewise, embracing
and congratulating him in the intervals. Without
taking a seat amongst the Scribes and Pharisees,
it is perhaps permissible to notice that such a<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>
scene as this is in curious contrast to that to be seen
in any French or German country town when lots
are being drawn for conscription. There the
youth, who by drawing a lucky number escapes
serving his country, is congratulated, f&ecirc;ted, and led
in procession round the streets.</p>

<p>One hard and fast rule, however, Lumsden made.
He would take no low caste men; he would have
naught to say to the washermen, sweepers, and fiddlers[1]
of the village; he would take only the highest,
which in this land is the fighting caste. His argument
was one which still holds good. It is not in reason
to expect the classes which for hundreds of years have
been hewers of wood and drawers of water, and for
hundreds of years have been accustomed to receive
the cuffs and kicks of their village superiors, to
face readily the fighting classes in the day of battle.
The prestige of the soldier would be wanting to
them, and prestige counts for as much in the East as
elsewhere.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] A musician in India is a low caste person.</p></div>

<p>Yet holding these views, a brave man was a brave
man to Lumsden, be his birth or caste what it might
be. Most English-speaking people have read
Mr. Rudyard Kipling's poem about Gunga Din the
<i>bhisti</i>, or water-carrier, who by the unanimous
verdict of the soldiers was voted the bravest man
in the battle. Whether Mr. Kipling got that
incident from the Guides or not his poem does
not show, but there it actually occurred. The<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>
name of the bhisti was Juma, and so gallantly
did he behave in action at Delhi, calmly carrying
water to the wounded and dying under the most
tremendous fire, that the soldiers themselves said:
&quot;This man is the bravest of the brave, for without
arms or protection of any sort he is in the foremost
line; if any one deserves the star for valour this
man does.&quot; And so the highest distinction open
to an Indian soldier was bestowed on Juma the
bhisti; and further, the soldiers petitioned that he
should be enlisted and serve in the ranks as a
soldier, and no longer be menially employed. Nor
was this all: in spite of his low birth, in a country
where birth is everything, he rose step by step to
be a native officer; and then to crown his glory,
in the Afghan War he again won the star for
valour, and the clasp which that great distinction
carries. But this story is not about Juma, and so
we must reluctantly leave him and get to our theme.</p>

<p>At this time it so happened that the most
notorious highwayman and outlaw in the whole of
Yusafzai was one Dil&#257;wur Khan, a Khuttuk of
good family belonging to the village of Jehangira,
on the Kabul River near its junction with the
Indus. Brought up to the priesthood, his wild and
impetuous nature and love of adventure could not
brook a life of sedentary ease, and therefore, like
many a spirited young blood, both before and since,
he &quot;took to the road.&quot; In his case the step was
taken, if not actually with the sanction and blessing<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>
of his Church, at any rate with its unofficial consent.
In those days the Sikhs held by force the country of
the Faithful, and Hindus fattened on its trade. It
was no great sin therefore, indeed, an active merit,
that the sons of the Prophet, sword in hand, should
spoil the Egyptian, by night or by day, as provided
for by Allah.</p>

<p>To recount all the adventures of Dil&#257;wur would
fill a book, and require a Munchausen to write
it; but there was about them all a touch of
humour, and sometimes of almost boyish fun, accompanied
often by the rough courtesies of the gentlemen
of the road, which reminds one of Dick Turpin
and other famous exponents of the profession on
the highways of England.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that it was at this time
one of Lumsden's duties to hunt down and capture
Dil&#257;wur, who for just and sufficient cause was now
an outlaw, with a price on his head of no less than
two thousand rupees. Many a time and oft did
Lumsden and his men plan and strive, and ride
and hide, but no nearer could they get to the
capture of Dil&#257;wur.</p>

<p>Sitting one evening outside his tent, after yet
another unsuccessful attempt, it suddenly occurred
to Lumsden that Dil&#257;wur must have an astonishingly
intimate knowledge of every path, nullah,
and pass in the district to thus evade capture, as
well as a remarkably efficient intelligence department,
to give him timely warning. &quot;Just the man<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>
for the Guides,&quot; exclaimed Lumsden. &quot;I'll send for
him.&quot; A polite note was accordingly written inviting
Dil&#257;wur Khan to come into the Guides' camp, at
any time and place that fitted in with his other, and
doubtless more important, engagements, &quot;to talk
matters over.&quot; At the same time a free passport
was sent which would allow of his reaching the
camp unmolested. It speaks volumes for the high
estimate which British integrity had already earned
amongst these rough borderland people, that a man
with two thousand rupees on his head could
accept such an invitation. For the same man to have
accepted a similar invitation from the Sikhs, or even
from his own countrymen, would have been an act
of culpable and aimless suicide.</p>

<p>One fine day, therefore, Dil&#257;wur strolled into
camp, and he and Lumsden began &quot;to talk matters
over.&quot; After compliments, as the Eastern saying is,
Lumsden with much heartiness, and in that free and
easy manner which was his own, took Dil&#257;wur
with the utmost candour into his confidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, Dil&#257;wur,&quot; said he; &quot;you are a fine
fellow, and are living a fine free life of adventure,
and I daresay are making a fairly good thing out of
it. So far, although I have done my best, I have
failed to catch you, but catch you I assuredly shall
some day. And what do you suppose I shall do
with you when I do catch you? Why, hang you as
high as Haman,&mdash;a gentleman whose history appears
in our Good Book. Now, that's a poor ending for<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>
a fine soldier like you, and I'll make you an offer,
take it or leave it. I'll enlist you, and as many of
your men as come up to my standard, in the Guides,
and with decent luck you will soon be a native
officer, with good fixed pay, and a pension for your
old age, and, meanwhile, as much fighting as the
greatest glutton can wish for. Well, what do you
say?&quot;</p>

<p>Dil&#257;wur Khan first stared, thunderstruck at the
novelty and unexpectedness of the offer; and then,
tickled with the comical side of it, burst into a roar
of laughter. It was one of the very best jokes he
had ever heard. He, an outlaw, with a price on
his head, his sins forgiven, enlisted in the Guides,
with the prospect of becoming a native officer!
&quot;No, no,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;that won't do&quot;; and, still
shaking with laughter, rose to take his leave. And
as he walked away he was followed by the hearty
and genial voice of Lumsden roaring after him:
&quot;Mind, I'll catch you some day, Dil&#257;wur, and then
I'll hang you, as sure as my name's Lumsden!&quot;</p>

<p>Lumsden, having many other matters on hand,
thought nothing more about the matter, till,
much to his surprise, one day six weeks later, who
should walk calmly into his camp, without passport
or safe conduct, or anything save serene confidence
in the British officer, but Dil&#257;wur Khan.</p>

<p>&quot;I've been thinking of what you said,&quot; he began,
&quot;and I have come to enlist, and as many of my
band as you care to take.&quot;<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></p>

<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; said Lumsden, with great
affability. &quot;I thought you were a sensible fellow,
as well as a brave one.  I'll take you on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have, however, one condition to make,&quot;
solemnly continued the outlaw.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what's that?&quot; asked Lumsden, thinking
that he was going to drive some desperate bargain.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll enlist on one condition,&quot; replied Dil&#257;wur,
&quot;and that is, I must be let off doing the goose-step.
I really can't stand about on one leg, a
laughing-stock amongst a lot of recruits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, nonsense,&quot; laughed Lumsden; &quot;you'll
have to begin at the beginning, like everyone else.
The goose-step is one of the foundations of the
British Empire. If a king came into the army
he'd have to do it. Why, I had to do goose-step
myself! Of course you'll have to do it.&quot;</p>

<p>So with much good-humoured laughing and
chaffing Dil&#257;wur Khan enlisted; and for weeks
after one of the sights of Yusafzai, which notable
chiefs rode many a mile to see, was the dreaded
Dil&#257;wur, the terror of the Border, peacefully
balancing himself on one leg, under the careful
tuition of a drill-sergeant of the Guides.</p>

<p>Long years afterwards, when he had reached
the highest rank open to him, in one of his friendly
talks with Lumsden, he said: &quot;Yes, Sahib, when I
enlisted I thought you were one of the most unsophisticated
persons I had ever come across. All
I took on for was to learn your tricks and strategy,<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>
and how British troops were trained, and how they
made their <i>bandobust</i>[1] for war. Directly I had
learnt these things I had intended walking off
whence I came, to use my knowledge against my
enemies. But by the kindness of God I soon
learnt what clean and straight people the sahibs are,
dealing fairly by all, and devoid of intrigue and
underhand dealing. So I stopped on, and here
I am, my beard growing white in the service of the
Queen of England.&quot;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>Bandobust</i>, lit., a tying or binding; any system or mode of regulation
discipline; arrangements.</p></div>

<p>His early religious education had given Dil&#257;wur
more than the average insight into the intricacies
of Mahomedan doctrine, and being possessed of ready
wit, and considerable ability in debate, he was ever
anxious to enter into doctrinarian discussions with
the <i>mullahs</i>. Their superstitions especially came in
for his lively ridicule, and a good story is told by
old native officers illustrating his views. One
day, Dil&#257;wur with a crowd of other passengers was
crossing the Indus, which there was very deep and
rapid, in the ferry-boat. Being over-heavily
loaded, the boat, when it felt the strong current,
appeared in great danger of filling and sinking.
Then the Mahomedans on board with one accord
set up loud lamentations, and began to call upon
their saints to succour them. &quot;Oh Ali! Oh Hosein!
Oh K&aacute;ka Sahib! save us,&quot; they cried. Whereupon
Dil&#257;wur, not to be outdone, in his turn commenced<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>
yelling and shouting vociferously: &quot;Lumsden
Sahib! Oh Lumsden Sahib, save me!&quot; &quot;What
are you doing, you accursed infidel?&quot; exclaimed
the scandalised passengers, furiously. &quot;Why do
you supplicate Lumsden Sahib? It is enough to
sink the boat straight away.&quot; &quot;That is easily
explained,&quot; calmly replied Dil&#257;wur. &quot;You are
calling on saints who have been dead for ages, while
Lumsden Sahib is alive and lives close by. Personally
I consider it more sensible to call on a living
man than on a dead saint.&quot;</p>

<p>On another occasion his enthusiasm in the cause
of religious enlightenment nearly cost him his life.
When the Amir Dost Mahomed Khan came
to Peshawur in 1856, he was accompanied by Hafiz
Ji, a leading mullah of Afghanistan and a great
doctrinarian; to whom came the learned amongst
the Faithful, to discuss the tenets of their religion
and to listen to the wisdom of the wise. With them
came also Dil&#257;wur, full of zeal and thirsting for
knowledge, who artlessly introduced so debatable
a subject, that the assembly was thrown into an
uproar; and lest worse things might happen unto
him, the worthy, but too enquiring, subadar was
hustled hastily forth, and requested in future to stick
to soldiering, and to avoid bringing his infernal
questions to cause discord amongst the chosen of the
Prophet. As Dil&#257;wur afterwards pathetically remarked,
he &quot;didn't think much of a religion which
instead of meeting argument with argument only<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>
threw stones at the head of the seeker after knowledge.&quot;
Indeed the occasion seems to have
thoroughly unsettled him in the convictions of his
youth, for shortly afterwards he finally shook off all
connection with the Mahomedan religion, and
turning Christian was baptised at Peshawur in 1858.</p>

<p>During the Mutiny he did excellent service,
making the famous march to Delhi with the Guides,
and serving with them throughout the siege and
storming of that place. He served also in the
many skirmishes which occurred on the frontier
during the next twelve years, getting what he
had bargained for on joining, plenty of fighting.
And then came that call of duty which asked of the
staunch old warrior to lay down his life for the
foreign Queen whose good servant he was.</p>

<p>In 1869 the British Government wanted a man
to go on a special and important mission, a man
of infinite resource, well educated, hardy and brave,
for he would need to carry his life in his hands
for many a long day and many a weary mile.
The man selected was Dil&#257;wur Khan, and joyfully
he undertook the risks and excitement of the
service. With him went a comrade, Ahmed Jan,
also of the Guides. The two set forth together,
and after many hardships and adventures had
reached the territory of the Mehtar of Chitral, and
were nearing the completion of their task. Seated
one day under a tree, making their midday halt
and chatting with some fellow travellers, they were<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>
suddenly surrounded by the soldiers of the Mehtar
and hurried back under close guard to Chitral.
Seeing danger ahead, Dil&#257;wur, before he was
searched, managed to drop into the river certain
documents and reports of a secret nature, which it
was important should not fall into strange hands.</p>

<p>On arrival at Chitral he and his companions
were thrown into prison, there to await the
Mehtar's pleasure. When eventually they were
brought before him, that chieftain, addressing
Dil&#257;wur, asked, &quot;Who are you and whence
come you?&quot; &quot;I am the Mullah Dil&#257;wur,&quot; replied
the prisoner, &quot;on my way from Bokh&#257;ra on a
religious mission.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you are not,&quot; replied the Mehtar; &quot;you
are Subadar Dil&#257;wur of the Guides, a heretic and
an infidel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite true,&quot; answered Dil&#257;wur readily; &quot;I was
at one time a subadar of the Guides, but I have
been many things in my time, and now I am a
mullah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have reliable information,&quot; said the Mehtar,
&quot;that you are in the secret employment of the
British Government.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go to,&quot; laughed Dil&#257;wur, &quot;what next? I have
a proposal to make. If you doubt that I am a
mullah, and not an ignorant one, be pleased to call
together all your most learned priests and I will
discuss doctrine with them, till all are convinced.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you will confess and tell me the secrets of the<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>
Government,&quot; replied the Mehtar, &quot;I will give you
a handsome present and take you into my service.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have no secrets,&quot; said Dil&#257;wur, &quot;and I beg
of your Highness to allow me to proceed on my
way. On my arrival at the <i>ziarat</i>[1] of the K&aacute;ka
Sahib near Nowshera I will make a special offering
on behalf of your Highness, and extol your
generosity.&quot;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>Ziarat</i>, cemetery.</p></div>

<p>But the Mehtar evidently had very straight
information regarding Dil&#257;wur, and it was the
custom of the land to kill all strangers who could
not account for themselves, and more especially
those who had any connection with the dreaded
Feringhis. For the Pathan saying is: &quot;First comes
one Englishman, as a traveller or for <i>shikar</i>;[2] then
come two and make a map; then comes an army
and takes the country. It is better therefore to kill
the first Englishman.&quot; Dil&#257;wur was consequently
sent back to prison, and a meeting of the mullahs
decided that he should be stoned to death as an
apostate. &quot;It must be the will of God,&quot; said this
brave man when the news was brought him, and
prepared to meet his fate.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[2] <i>Shikar</i>, sport.</p></div>

<p>But not yet was his time fulfilled. For two
months he and his travelling companions were kept
in prison, probably to enable the Mehtar to correspond
with his agents in Peshawur. The reply
received was evidently not in favour of extreme<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>
measures for the strong arm of the British was
notoriously far-reaching, and serious trouble might
ensue if the subadar were killed. The Mehtar
therefore decided to release the prisoners, and to
give them such assistance as they needed in getting
away.</p>

<p>On their way towards India the little party got
as far as the great range of mountains, some twenty-four
thousand feet in height, which divide Chitral
from Bajaur, and attempted to cross it by the Nuksan
Pass, the Pass of Death. For four days and nights
they struggled on, through the ever deepening snow
and ever increasing cold. Dil&#257;wur Khan's comrade,
Ahmed Jan, was the first to die; and then, on the
fourth night, the brave old soldier himself gave out,
and as he was dying he called to him one of the
survivors, and said: &quot;Should any of you reach India
alive, go to the Commissioner of Peshawur and say
'Dil&#257;wur Khan of the Guides is dead'; and say also
that he died faithful to his salt, and happy to give
up his life in the service of the Great Queen.&quot;</p>

<p>So he died, and the eternal snows cover as with
a soft and kindly sheet the rugged soldier who knew
no fear. The serene and majestic silence of the
mountain is given to him whose life in the plain
below had been one great and joyous fight from the
cradle to the grave.</p>

<h4>THE GREAT MARCH TO DELHI</h4>


<p>For the Guides the great tragedy of 1857 opened
with the mutiny of the 55th Native Infantry. When
this regiment first showed signs of insubordination
it was quartered at the neighbouring cantonment of
Nowshera, then slenderly garrisoned by British
troops, but with many European women and children.
For safety's sake it was therefore thought better to
isolate the regiment by sending it over to Mardan.
With the news of the outbreak at Meerut the
demeanour of the regiment became more sullen and
menacing, and it was accordingly decided at once to
disarm the sepoys. For this purpose a column was
sent from Peshawur, consisting of a wing of the
70th Foot, a portion of the 5th Punjab Infantry
under Vaughan, two hundred and fifty sabres of the
10th Irregular Cavalry, and some Mounted Police;
the whole under Colonel Chute of the 70th Foot,
with John Nicholson as political officer.</p>

<p>The 55th Native Infantry had been warned that the
column was coming, and when, from the walls of the<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>
fort, they saw it approaching, they broke and fled,
taking the K&#257;tlung road, thus hoping to escape across
the border into Swat and Buner. Nicholson with the
cavalry and mounted police immediately started in
pursuit. The cavalry, themselves disaffected, did
no execution whatever; but the police behaved with
great dash and gallantry, killing one hundred and
twenty, and capturing one hundred and fifty of the
mutineers. The remainder escaped across the border,
but their fate was only postponed. Some were
murdered by the tribesmen, some driven back into
British territory, captured and hanged, and some were
blown from guns before the eyes of the garrison of
Peshawur. Of the whole regiment all were
destroyed except a few scores who escaped the
gallows and the guns to suffer transportation for life.
Such was the terrible ending of the 55th Native
Infantry; a signal and, as it proved, a most effective
warning, the results of which were felt over the whole
of the north-west corner of India.</p>

<p>A distressing and pathetic tragedy resulted from
the mutiny of this regiment. Colonel Henry
Spottiswoode who commanded it, like so many other
officers, absolutely refused to believe in the disloyalty
of his men. He was one of those who held the view
that distrust bred disaffection, which with confidence
would never appear. So deeply distressed was this
chivalrous officer when his regiment rebelled, that
he refused to outlive what to him was an indelible
disgrace, and so, going apart, shot himself dead.<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>
According to an old soldier, then in the Guides,
he fell and was buried under a great mulberry tree
at the cross-roads near the fort.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Guides, at six hours' notice, fully
equipped, horse and foot, had started on their
historic march to Delhi. They left Mardan at
six in the evening of May 13th, and joined the
British force at the siege of Delhi early on June 9th.
The distance is five hundred and eighty miles,
and the time taken was twenty-six days and
fourteen hours; but from this must be deducted five
days and nine hours made up as follows: detained
forty-two hours at Attock, holding the fort pending
the arrival of a reliable garrison; detained forty-one
hours at Rawul Pindi, pending the question as to
whether the Guides were to be employed to disarm
the native artillery; detained forty-six hours at
Karnal by the magistrate, in order to attack,
capture, and burn a hostile village lying twelve miles
off the road. If, therefore, these halts &quot;by order&quot;
are deducted, it will be found that the Guides took
actually twenty-one days and five hours to march five
hundred and eighty miles. This works out to an
average of over twenty-seven miles a day. As a
contemporary historian remarks, such a feat would be
highly creditable to mounted troops, and was doubly
so to the infantry portion of the corps. To add to
the credit of this high achievement, it may be added
that the march took place at the hottest season of
the year through the hottest region on earth.<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></p>

<p>The record of a march along the Grand Trunk
Road of India does not lend itself to much picturesque
description, but perhaps it may be in this
case of some interest to follow the stern resolve and
steady endurance which carried the stout-hearted
regiment through those never-ending miles along the
straight and scorching road to Delhi. And in this
endeavour we are singularly fortunate in having for
reference a diary written from day to day by Henry
Daly, who, in the absence of Lumsden on a special
mission, commanded the corps.&nbsp;[1]</p>

<div class="footnote">[1] <i>Memoirs of General Sir Henry Dermot Daly, G.C.B., C.I.E.;</i> by
Major H. Daly. London, 1905.</div>

<p>The first night's march took the Guides sixteen
miles to Nowshera, where after barely two hours' rest
came orders to push on to Attock, another eighteen
miles. To add to the hardships of this march, it so
chanced that the Mahomedan fast of Ramzan was
in observance, during which no follower of the
Prophet may eat or drink between sunrise and
sunset. Parched, hungry, and weary, the thirty-four
mile march was completed, and the Indus
crossed at ten in the morning of the 14th of May.</p>

<p>Halting by order forty-two hours at Attock, to allow
of the arrival of a relief garrison, the Guides pushed
on thirty-two miles to Burhan, on the night of the
15th&mdash;16th, in the midst of a violent dust storm.
Many of the men were very footsore from their long
march of the previous day, but all were cheerful and
light-hearted, making naught of their hardships.<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></p>

<p>Another thirty-two mile march brought the corps to
J&#257;ni-ki-Sang, and took them the next morning fifteen
miles in to Rawul Pindi. On the road Herbert
Edwardes passed the corps, and drove Daly on into
Rawul Pindi, there to meet the great hearts of the
Punjab, John Lawrence, Neville Chamberlain, and
John Nicholson.</p>

<p>A day was spent here in consultation on the broad
aspect of affairs, and locally as to the advisability,
or otherwise, of using the Guides to disarm the native
artillery in garrison. Finally it was decided not to
do so, and thus with the gruff but kindly farewells of
John Lawrence, and the light-hearted chaff and high
spirits of Herbert Edwardes, Daly and his men
again set forth, and on the night of the 19th&mdash;20th
made a twenty mile march to Mandra. There was
no falling off in the cheerful endeavour, nor was any
man so tired or footsore that he would be content
to be left behind.</p>

<p>The next march brought the corps to Sohawa,
twenty-four miles, made trying by hot scorching
winds and the deep and intricate nullahs which had
to be crossed. Then followed twenty-eight miles,
and in delightful contrast the vicinity of great rushing
waters made a little heaven of the camp on the
banks of the Jhelum. But it was not for long; at
dusk trumpets and bugles again sound the advance,
and amidst a great storm of dust and rain the second
of the great rivers of the Punjab is crossed, and in
addition to the great difficulty and delay of a night<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>
passage, yet another twenty-one miles are added
to the marching score before daylight. The 24th
being a cooler day, Daly resolved to push on another
fifteen miles to the Chenab, and to cross that river
during the course of the night. This was safely
accomplished, and by early morning on the 24th all
were on the eastern bank at Wazirabad. That night
the men were called upon for another thirty-two
mile march, and daylight saw them at Kamok&eacute;.
Resting all day nightfall again found them on the
road completing another thirty miles into Lahore,
the capital of the Punjab. The hour was six in the
morning, and the date the 26th of May, from which
it will be seen that the Guides had so far covered
two hundred and sixty-seven miles in ten and a
half marching-days.</p>

width="534" height="383" /></div>

<p>At Lahore Daly picked up some recruits to replace
casualties, as well as to have a few in hand to meet
future vacancies. Marching on, the banks of the
Sutlej, close to the battlefield of Sobraon, forty-three
miles from Lahore, were reached early on the 29th,
and the passage of this, the fifth great river of the
Punjab, was at once commenced. Then on again at
dusk thirty-two more miles to Mihna; a more than
usually trying march this, for a cross-country road
caused many to lose their way, and it was twenty-four
hours before all the baggage was in. This
necessitated making the next a short march, in order
that all might get into trim again; so at midnight,
at the fourteenth milestone, Daly called a halt,<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>
and all slept the sleep of those who have endured
much. June 1st saw the corps march into Ludhiana
at three in the morning, after covering twenty-four
miles. Here all was silence, and the officers, using
the lowest step of the court-house as a pillow, slept
soundly till dawn.</p>

<p>A pleasant restful day in the great cool house of the
Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Ricketts, with such
unheard of luxuries as cold water and iced ginger-beer
to drink, and cool sheets to lie on, put fresh
vigour into the little band of British officers, and off
they went at half-past seven in the evening for a
twenty-eight mile march to Alawi-ke-Serai.
Another march, next night, of the same distance
brought the corps to Rajpoora. They were now
close to Umballa, and another night march brought
them, at one in the morning of June 4th, to the
deserted cantonment.</p>

<p>Here they were received in friendly fashion by the
troopers of the Maharaja of Patiala, who had been left
in charge, and were conducted to a grove of great
trees near a tank, probably in the vicinity of the
present racecourse. After a good day's rest under
the trees the march was continued to Pipli, twenty-six
miles, where a letter was received from Mr.
Barnes, the Commissioner, giving news of the
force at Meerut, and inferring that they were not
much more than holding their own.</p>

<p>At Karnal, twenty-four miles onward, and now
nearing their goal, two causes of delay crossed their<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>
path. Cholera, that ancient scourge of the East
which finds its easiest prey when men are physically
impoverished with great exertions, now attacked the
dusty road-worn corps, three Gurkhas being the first
victims, while seven or eight more men were down
the same evening. At the same time came a call
from Mr. Le Bas, the magistrate, strongly backed
by Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, to turn aside in order
to burn a mutinous village. Greatly demurring at
any delay in reaching his main objective, the demand
was so urgent that Daly felt bound to comply with
it. His compliance cost him small loss, but the delay
cost the British cause the help of the Guides at the
battle of Budlika-Serai. Though too late for that
fight, however, they were in time for many another
before the walls of Delhi.</p>

<p>The moral effect of the arrival of the Guides in
Delhi was perhaps in some measure greater even
than the actual fighting strength thus brought into
line. The fame of the march from the far distant
frontier, the fine physique and martial bearing of
soldiers drawn from warlike tribes new to the
eyes of their British comrades, the encouraging
and enheartening effect of the arrival of reinforcements
however small, all tended to give the
approach of the travel-stained Guides a high significance.
Some such thought perhaps intuitively
occurred to all; and every soldier who could claim
to be off duty rushed to the dusty road-side, and
hoarsely cheered the gallant fellows who had overcome<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>
so much to reach the side of their British
comrades, hard set to uphold the great Empire of
Clive and Warren Hastings. It is interesting,
at this distance of time, to find recorded the
impression of an eye-witness who was amongst
those who watched and cheered as the Guides,
after a last thirty mile march, strode manfully into
the camp at Delhi, on this, the morning of the
9th of June, 1857. &quot;Their stately height and
martial bearing,&quot; says this onlooker, &quot;made all
who saw them proud to have such aid. They
came in as firm and light as if they had marched
but a single mile.&quot;</p>

<p>At the end of this great march rest and peace
for a day or two had assuredly been earned. But
no; as the Guides approach the historic Ridge,
a staff officer, sent out to meet them, gallops up, and
after giving friendly greeting, with the General's
compliments, asks, &quot;How soon will you be ready
to go into action?&quot; &quot;In half an hour,&quot; is the
gallant Daly's cheery reply. And thus it came
about that history added one more touch of
glory to a great achievement. A little space of
time there was for partial rest and hard-earned
food, and then the trumpet calls to seize their
arms and face the foe they had come so far to
fight. And in that fight both horse and foot
showed great and glorious valour; but when
evening came, and beaten back the rebels hid
behind the walls of Delhi, the roll-call told its<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>
sad undying story. Full many a Guide had made
that strenuous march but to lay down his life e'er
yet he had pitched his tent. And brightest lights,
as was meet, amidst these heroes, were the little
band of British officers, for of those, in that one
first fight, all were killed or wounded. Amongst the
latter was the lion-hearted, ever-cheerful Daly; and
amongst the former the first of the great soldier-name
of Battye to die a soldier's death. And as he
died in that great agony his face lit up, and calm and
smooth came the grand old Roman verse:</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.<br />
</div>

<p>The story of the Guides before Delhi is the story
of all that gallant band who through the blazing heat,
'midst sickness and disease, fought the good fight
right through the summer of 1857, and with them
shared in the crowning glory of the final assault and
capture of the capital of the Great Mogul. Hence
after a few months' harrying and chasing of rebel
bands, with sadly diminished numbers, but still stout
of heart, the order came for the Guides to return
to their home on the distant frontier.</p>

<p>In the midst of so much treachery, such dastardly
deeds of murder and rapine, the bright light of
unwavering fidelity, sealed and confirmed by surpassing
gallantry in the field, so appealed to the hearts
of the storm-pressed Englishmen, that the Guides
received little short of an ovation when they returned
to Peshawur. By order of Major-General Sir<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>
Sidney Cotton the whole of the garrison was
paraded to receive the shattered remnants of that
war-worn corps. On their approach a royal salute
was fired by the artillery, and cavalry and infantry
came to the salute while the massed bands played.
The General then made a most eloquent and affecting
address, welcoming the corps back to the
frontier, and expressing the pride and honour felt
by all in being associated with men whose deeds of
daring had earned for themselves and their noble
profession undying fame. They had taken six
hundred men to Delhi and their casualties had
reached three hundred and fifty. During the siege
the whole strength in British officers had been
renewed four times, and all these had been killed
or wounded. One officer indeed had been wounded
six times and yet survived, another four times, and
others at least twice.</p>

<p>After his stirring speech, the General called for
three cheers for the little band of ragged and war-worn
heroes, who stood before them. A <i>feu de joie</i>
accompanied by a salute of twenty-one guns was
then fired, and after this the Guides, taking the
place of honour at the head of the line, marched
past the flag.</p>

<h4>TWENTY YEARS OF MINOR WARS</h4>

<p>Short breathing space, and little of the rest of
peace awaited the Guides on their return from
Delhi. Within two months they were again taking
the field, under Sir Sidney Cotton, against the
Hindustani fanatics of Sittana.</p>

<p>These fanatics, as they were called, were really
refugees from British territory, for the most part deserters
from corps that had mutinied, or outlaws who
had participated in some unforgivable outrage; some,
however, were clean-handed patriots, who, on
principle, refused to bow to the decree of destiny,
or to become peaceful subjects of the Queen. If the
latter had remained quiet and inoffensive members
of tribes or communities beyond our borders, the
British Government, never vindictive, would probably,
as the heat and passions of a desperate war
died down, have left them to their solitude. But
instead of thus living peaceably in the asylum they
had found, they set about inciting their hot-blooded
neighbours to join them in disturbing the peace of<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>
the border. They harried villages, drove off cattle,
killed and wounded British subjects, and thus
became an additional disturbing feature on a frontier
always ready enough for the pleasure of a good
fight. The opportunity was therefore taken of the
presence of Sir Sidney Cotton's column to make them
feel that the strong hand of the British Government
could reach them even in their mountain fastnesses.</p>

<p>With the co-operation of a force from the Hazara
district Sittana, the stronghold of the Hindustanis,
was skilfully surrounded, and a fierce hand-to-hand
conflict ensued. Their Pathan allies, whose hearts
were evidently not in the business, showed but lukewarm
enthusiasm, and escaped as best they could;
but the Hindustanis stood to a man. They fought
like fanatics, coming boldly and doggedly on, and
going through all the preliminary attitudes and posturing
of the Indian prize-ring. Their advance was
made steadily and in perfect silence, without a shout
or a word of any kind, unlike the yelling charge of the
Afghan <i>ghazi</i>. All were dressed in their bravest and
best for the occasion, as is meet for him who goes to
meet his Lord, most of them in pure white, but
some of the leaders in richly embroidered velvet
coats. The fight was short, desperate, and decisive;
and in the end every one of these brave,
if misguided, warriors was killed or captured. The
brunt of the charge fell on the 18th Punjab Infantry,
who lost one officer and sixteen men in the encounter.<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></p>

<p>Many another fight too did the Guides have during
the next few years with unvarying success,
but we may perhaps pass the less important by, and
come to the stiff encounter that faced them during the
expedition against the Mahsud Waziri tribe in 1860.</p>

<p>The British force operating in that country had in
the course of the campaign been split up into two
columns; one under Sir Neville Chamberlain[1] had
gone forward, lightly equipped, into the Waziri fastnesses;
while a weaker column, some one thousand
five hundred strong under Lumsden and including
the Guides, was left at Pallosin to guard camp,
equipage, and stores. Knowing the enemy he had to
deal with, and his predilection for, and skill in
executing the unexpected in war, Lumsden drew in his
camp, so as to make it as snug and defensible as possible,
and putting out strong picquets with their
supports all round, he awaited the few days' absence
of the main column. During the interval no signs
of the enemy could be seen, nor could any news of
him be obtained by means of spies. To all intents
and purposes he seemed to have disappeared, and the
little column lay, apparently unnoticed and unheeded,
amidst the great mountains. Yet suddenly, from
anywhere, from nowhere, from the very bowels of
the earth, the Waziris rose in their thousands, and
hurled themselves at the British camp.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] Afterwards Field-Marshal Sir Neville Chamberlain, G.C.B., &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><i>R&eacute;veille</i> was just sounding in the grey dawn of
April 23rd, when three thousand Waziris armed with<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>
swords and guns, and fired with fierce fanaticism,
boldly charged that side of the camp which was held
by the Guides. The storm first fell on the outlying
picquets, who fired a volley, and then received the
great rush of white-robed swordsmen on their
bayonets. They fought with the utmost gallantry,
but the weight of numbers was against them, and in
a few minutes, standing bravely at their posts, they
were practically annihilated. Yet the strife was not
in vain, for it was strong enough to cause all but
the bravest of the brave to pause before proceeding
to attack the kernel of the nut, whose shell had
been so hard to crack. And thus it came about
that only five hundred of the three thousand
swordsmen faced the death beyond. These, with
scarce a pause, and calling loudly on Allah to give
them victory, swept swiftly on to the camp of the
Guides. In that war-seasoned corps, half an hour
before dawn, wet or dry, in freezing cold or tropical
heat, the inlying picquet, a hundred strong, falls
in, and stands silent, fully equipped, armed, and
ready for all emergencies, till broad daylight shows
all clear and safe. At the first sound of the firing
Lumsden jumped to his feet, and taking this inlying
picquet, rushed out of camp at its head, and
so posted it as to enfilade and hold in check the
great body of Waziris who now darkened the skyline.
Then, hastening back to camp, he reached
it almost abreast of the five hundred, who were not
to be denied.<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></p>

alt="A non-commissioned officer of the Guides' Infantry"
title="A non-commissioned officer of the Guides' Infantry"
width="396" height="565" /></div>

<p>Now commenced the very babel of conflict;
horses and mules neighing and screaming and
straining at their ropes, dogs barking, men yelling,
the clash of swords, the rattle and crash of musketry,
the screams of the wounded and the groans of the
dying. Was ever such a pandemonium? The
Guides in small knots, though hard stricken, fought
with determined courage; but they were gradually
driven back, inch by inch, till they were almost on
to the guns parked in the rear. Then came to the
rescue the keen resource and ready courage of the
British subaltern. Borne back in the rush were
Lieutenants Bond and Lewis of the Guides; but in
the awful din and confusion they could at first do little
else but defend themselves. Gradually, however, they
formed the few men near them into a rough line, and
by dint of shouting and passing the word along,
succeeded in getting more men to catch the notion;
till in a few minutes they had the best part of two
hundred men in line right across the camp. Then came
the order passed along with a roar, &quot;Fix bayonets!&quot;
This order was in fact superfluous, for every man
was already busy holding his own with his bayonet;
but there is a certain sequence in military orders,
which in times of confusion tend to steady the
nerves with the cool touch of drill and discipline.
The sequence of the order &quot;Fix bayonets!&quot; is
&quot;Charge!&quot; When that sequence came a wild
cheer echoed down the line of the Guides; as
one man they leaped forward, and with thrust and<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>
staggering blow cleared the camp of the enemy.
As they retreated the 4th Sikhs and 5th Gurkhas
took them in flank, and in a few minutes turned a
repulse into a headlong flight. The enemy left
one hundred and thirty-two dead on the ground,
ninety-two of whom were in the Guides' camp, and
carried off immense numbers of wounded and dying.
The Guides lost thirty-three killed and seventy-four
wounded.</p>

<p>This was Lumsden's last fight at the head of the
Guides. Now a Lieutenant-Colonel and a Companion
of the Bath, his promotion was assured, and
it came with his transfer to the command of the
Hyderabad contingent, with the rank of Brigadier-General.
This fine soldier from the raising of the
corps in 1846 had held command of it for sixteen
years; the brightest example of what a brave,
chivalrous, and resourceful leader should be. Commanders
of regiments come and go, and few leave
their mark; but over the Guides the influence of
Lumsden still burns bright and clear. To be alert
and ready; to rise equal to the occasion, be the
call small or great; to be not easily taken aback
in a sudden emergency; to be a genial comrade
and a good sportsman,&mdash;such are the simple soldier
maxims left to his comrades by one of the best
soldiers who ever drew sword.</p>

<p>The extraordinary devotion felt for Lumsden by
the rude warriors whom he had enlisted and trained
to war was somewhat pathetically, if quaintly, illus<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>trated
by an incident that occurred not long
before he left. Sir John Lawrence, then Lieutenant-Governor
of the Punjab, had been round to inspect
the Guides, for in those days they were not under
the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, but directly
under the Civil Government. Something in the
course of the day had occurred to put Sir John
Lawrence out of humour, and he was at all times
a man of blunt speech. Whatever it was, it temporarily
annoyed Lumsden, and quite unwittingly
this became evident to the faithful fellows who were
ready to charge into hell-fire at his order. It was
a mere passing cloud, for the cheery bright-hearted
Lumsden was no man to brood over small matters
of this sort. As, however, he sat out under the stars
smoking his last pipe, he became aware of a figure
in the background, and turning round saw one of his
orderlies respectfully standing at attention.</p>

<p>&quot;Hullo! What's up?&quot; asked Lumsden.</p>

<p>&quot;It is only this,&quot; replied the orderly, one of the
rough warriors who took orders only from his own
sahibs, and cared not a jot for any other man,
black or white. &quot;It is only this, Sahib: I and my
comrades noticed that the Lord Sahib spoke to-day
words that were not pleasing to your Excellency,
and that you were angry and displeased when you
heard them. So we have consulted together as to
how best we may serve the proper end; for it is not
right and proper that we should allow our Colonel
Sahib to be harshly spoken to by anyone. There is,<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>
therefore, this alternative: the Lord Sahib has
arranged to leave by the straight road to-morrow
morning for Peshawur, but with your honour's kind
permission, and by the Grace of God, there is no
reason whatever why he should ever reach it.&quot;
That man thoroughly meant what he said, and
to this day the same touching devotion of the men to
their officers, though perhaps less bluntly expressed,
is still one of the characteristics of the Guides.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards Lord William Beresford,
when Military Secretary to the Viceroy, was fond
of telling a story not only illustrative of the personal
equation which would cause one of the rough and
ready old soldiers to refuse obedience to any
but his own officers, but also giving a somewhat
embarrassing illustration of a sentry adhering too
literally to his orders. Lord William was somewhat
annoyed at the time; but when cooler, he saw the
sound military spirit underlying the incident, and
hence always mentioned it with commendation.</p>

<p>It appears that as the Guides' cavalry were
marching in to Rawul Pindi for a concentration of
troops, just before they reached their camping-ground
they passed a pond by the roadside. The
officer commanding turning round, called one of the
men to him and said: &quot;Go, stand sentry on that
pond, and don't let anyone water there, till we have
watered our horses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good, your Honour,&quot; replied the trooper,
and went and posted himself.<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></p>

<p>What the commanding officer really meant was,
not to allow cattle and transport animals to dirty
the water before the horses came down to drink;
but he did not express himself very clearly.</p>

<p>Shortly after the sentry had taken up his beat a
string of horses, headed by a gorgeous being in
a scarlet uniform, appeared, making for the pond.</p>

<p>&quot;Hullo! you there, where are you going?&quot;
shouted the sentry.</p>

<p>&quot;Going?&quot; repeated the gorgeous being, superciliously.
&quot;Why, to water my horses, you stupid
fool.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No you don't,&quot; said the sentry; &quot;no one waters
here till the Guides have finished with it.&quot;</p>

<p>The gorgeous person nearly fell off his horse with
astonishment, and when he found speech he replied:
&quot;Cease prattling, son of an impure mother! These
are the Great Lord's horses, and can of course water
where and when they choose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care a quarter of an anna whose horses
they are, but they don't water here. So, out of this,
you mis-begotten son of a red-coated ape, or I'll give
you something to help you along.&quot; And the sentry
quietly pulled out a cartridge, and began leisurely
fitting it into the breech of his carbine.</p>

<p>This was not at all to the red-coated gentleman's
liking. To trot behind his Lord, richly caparisoned
and splendidly mounted, was one thing; but to meet
an infernal fellow who deliberately fitted a cartridge
into his carbine to defend his post, was a<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>
matter not lightly to be undertaken. Accordingly
he galloped off to fetch his native officer. When
this officer arrived he was much enraged, and
roundly abused the sentry, calling him every name
under the sun, and casting the gravest reflections on
the whole of his ancestors, especially on the female
side.</p>

<p>But the sentry stood like a block of wood, and
when the other had finished answered: &quot;I don't
know who you are, and don't care; and for the
present you may talk as much as you like, though
when I am at liberty I also shall have a few words
to say. But I am sentry here on this pond, and my
orders are such and such, and I mean to obey them.
The first man who tries to force me I hit with a
bullet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was there ever such a person?&quot; said the native
officer. &quot;He must be mad! And the Great Lord's
horses too! God preserve him; he will certainly
be hanged, or sent across the Black Water for life.&quot;</p>

<p>So he too rode off to fetch his sahib; and shortly a
trail of dust on the road showed that he was returning,
and not leisurely. The officer was hot, indignant,
and vexed, and said to the sentry: &quot;By my
order you will allow the Viceroy's horses to water at
this pond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With every respect,&quot; replied the sentry, &quot;my
own Sahib has given me other orders, and I mean
to obey him.&quot;</p>

<p>And nothing the officer could say, and he said a<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>
good deal, could move the sentry one hair'sbreadth
from that resolve. So he, in his turn, rode off to
fetch the last court of appeal, the Military Secretary,
Lord William Beresford.</p>

<p>As all who knew him will remember, his Lordship
was very short and sharp when anything
occurred that in the least infringed the dignity of the
Viceroy, or of anything belonging to that exalted
personage; and probably few would have cared to be
in the shoes of that sentry during the next few minutes.
But the sentry was sublimely oblivious of the existence
of so high an official as a Military Secretary,
and only dimly aware of the existence of a Great
Lord. On the other hand his own Colonel Sahib
and his own sahibs, with whom he had fought
and bled, were real live people, whom he knew quite
well and whose word was law unto him. The
Military Secretary, therefore, being evidently an
older and more worthy sahib than the last, was
received with even more respect; but as to allowing
the horses to water, the sentry was adamant on
that point. &quot;I obey my Colonel's orders,&quot; said he,
&quot;and no one else's.&quot; Lord William, though greatly
vexed, as perhaps was only natural, was too good a
soldier to force a sentry, and rode off therefore to
the Guides' camp to lay the matter before the commanding
officer. The rest was naturally all cordiality
and good feeling, and an invitation to lunch; while
the Guides' subaltern galloped off and cut the Gordian
knot.<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></p>

<p>Scarcely had Lumsden parted from his beloved
corps, when they again took the field, in the small
but bloody Umbeyla campaign of 1863. The opening
incident was in what was coming to be honourably
looked upon as thoroughly Guides' fashion.
Two troops of the cavalry and two companies of the
infantry of this corps, under Jenkins,[1] were encamped
at Topi, blockading the Gaduns and Hindustani
fanatics preparatory to the advance of the field-force.
One night a patrol of three men, under
Duffadar Fakira, suddenly encountered a body of
about three hundred of the enemy, on their way
to surprise and capture the camp of the Guides.
Without a moment's hesitation, and with highly
commendable presence of mind, the duffadar began
shouting &quot;Fall in! fall in!&quot; as if addressing
countless legions; and then wheeling his three men
into line, and each man yelling like a dozen fiends,
fell with fury on the advancing enemy. The effect
was magical, the enemy thinking that they had
been betrayed, or forestalled, or had perchance fallen
into an ambush, and that opposed to them was the
whole strength of the Guides. In the darkness a
panic set in, and the whole force broke and fled,
their redoubted and sainted leader, the Mullah
Abdullah, showing the way.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] Afterwards Colonel Sir Francis Jenkins, K.C.B.</p></div>

<p>In the fierce and frequent fighting which
week after week, raged round the celebrated Crag
picquet, the Guides took their part. This picquet<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>
stood at the top of an abrupt and precipitous rock,
accessible from our side only by a narrow rocky path,
while towards the enemy the ground sloped away
to further hills. The weakness of the picquet,
therefore, lay not only in its openness to determined
attack, in days of short-range weapons and hand-to-hand
fighting, but also in the difficulty experienced
in quickly reinforcing it. Once taken, not only the
neighbouring post, known as the Monastery
picquet, but the whole camp lay under its commanding
fire.</p>

<p>The first occasion on which the Crag was seriously
attacked was before dawn on the 30th of October,
when the picquet was rushed, and the twelve men
of the 1st Punjab Infantry who held it were swept
from the crest, but like limpets bravely clung to the
near slopes. In support, close below, lay Major
Keyes[1] with the remainder of the 1st Punjab
Infantry and a company of the Guides. Owing to
the rocky and difficult ascent it was impossible to do
much till daylight, but with the first streak of dawn,
valuably aided by the flank fire of Major Brownlow[2]
and the 20th Punjab Infantry, Keyes himself at
the head of the storming party most gallantly
recaptured the Crag picquet at the point of the
bayonet. As illustrating the severity of this hand-to-hand
fighting, it may be mentioned that the enemy<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>
left sixty dead or dying, mostly Hindustani fanatics,
in and round the picquet, while our own losses
amounted to fifty-five.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] Afterwards Commandant of the Guides and later General Sir
Charles Keyes, K.C.B., etc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p>[2] Afterwards General Sir Charles Brownlow, G.C.B., etc.</p></div>

<p>In this gallant assault the company of the Guides
bore their share, and four of them are mentioned as
having been amongst the first into the recaptured
position. The next serious assault took place on
November the 12th, but after severe fighting was
beaten off by Major Brownlow and the 20th Punjab
Infantry, again supported by two companies of the
Guides. A native officer of the Guides was specially
mentioned on this occasion for carrying ammunition
at great personal risk up to the besieged picquet.
It was estimated that two thousand of the enemy
took part in this assault.</p>

<p>The third assault on this historic picquet was
made by the undaunted tribesmen on November
the 13th, when it was held by the 1st Punjab Infantry;
and so determined and strongly supported was the
attack that not only was the picquet, now one
hundred and twenty strong, driven off the hill, but
something like a panic spread amongst the followers
in camp, much disturbing the dispositions made for
recapturing the Crag. The first attempt to stem the
tide was made by detachments of the Guides and 1st
Punjab Infantry, but these were not strong enough to
retake the picquet, and could barely hold their own.
Then came to the rescue Major C.C.G. Ross with
detachments of the Guides, 1st Punjab Infantry, and
14th Native Infantry, which, charging up, got close<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>
to the crest, but were not strong enough to drive out
the swarms of determined warriors grimly holding
the vantage ground.</p>

<p>The matter had now reached a serious point, at
once apparent to Sir Neville Chamberlain; for the
possession of the Crag picquet by the enemy made
untenable the whole British position. He therefore
immediately ordered to the assault the 101st Royal
Bengal Fusiliers.[1] This gallant regiment aided by
three companies of the Guides, and the line swelled
by Major Ross's mixed detachments, without a
check stormed and captured the position with the
bayonet. The enemy lost two hundred and thirty
men in this gallant attempt, while our own casualties
reached one hundred and fifty-eight.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] Now the Royal Munster Fusiliers.</p></div>

<p>The final attempt came on the afternoon of
November the 20th. The post was then garrisoned
by one hundred bayonets of the 101st Royal Bengal
Fusiliers and one hundred bayonets of the 20th
Punjab Infantry. Again so determined was the
attack, and made in such strength, that the British
garrison was swept from the hill with considerable
loss. The position of affairs was now so critical
that Sir Neville Chamberlain himself determined
to lead the columns detailed to assault and retake
the picquet. In this fine advance the 71st Highland
Light Infantry, supported by the Guides, made the
frontal attack, and so impetuous was their charge
that the summit was reached and the enemy driven<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>
from it with little loss. Our total casualties in the
affair, however, reached one hundred and fifty-three,
while the estimated loss of the enemy was three
hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>Such was the history of the Crag picquet, four
times fiercely attacked with overwhelming numbers
by a brave and fanatical foe, thrice captured, and
thrice by sterling grit and stout endeavour bravely
recaptured. Of a surety this bloody site has earned
the title given it by all the countryside. It is
called the <i>Kutlgar</i>, or the Place of Slaughter, for
of friend and foe well nigh a thousand warriors had
shed their blood to keep or take that barren rock.</p>

<p>Eight of the Guides received the Indian soldiers'
highest reward for conspicuous gallantry in the field
during these strenuous assaults and counter assaults.</p>

<p>Though this was no cavalry country, as may
readily be judged, several troops of the Guides'
cavalry, together with the 11th Bengal Cavalry, did
useful service on more than one occasion, under the
gallant leadership of Colonel Dighton Probyn,[1] one
of the brilliant band of cavalry soldiers who had
earned undying fame in the great Mutiny. It is
perhaps the memory of those old days of dangers
and troubles passed through together, that keeps
alive the kindly feeling which leads Sir Dighton
Probyn to write a few words of brave encouragement
when his old comrades of the Guides take<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>
their share of such fighting as still, from time to
time, falls to their lot. On their side the Guides
look on him, along with Lumsden and Jenkins and
other old heroes, as one of their own sahibs.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] Later the Right Honourable Sir Dighton Probyn, V.C., G.C.B.
G.C.S.I., G.C.V.O., P.C., etc. etc., Keeper of the Privy Purse.</p></div>

<p>The element of secrecy is absolutely essential to a
successful surprise. This is a military truism all the
world over, but applies with special force amongst
the Pathan tribes on the North-West Frontier of
India, as indeed it did amongst the Boers, and for
probably a very similar reason. They were not
always professional spies whom the Boers employed;
nor is it always a Pathan spy who is on
the spot. But both peoples without having any
highly organised system have been exceedingly
fortunate in the manner in which information of
impending movements has somehow got reported
in the nick of time in the most interesting quarter.</p>

<div><a name="pg092" id="pg092" /></div>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/jp092.jpg"
alt="An Afridi of the Guides' Infantry"
title="An Afridi of the Guides' Infantry"
width="403" height="553" /></div>

<p>Due south from Mardan, and distant, as the
crow flies, some thirty-five to forty miles, lies the
village of Paia, which for high crimes and misdemeanours,
including murder, rapine, and arson, it was
considered necessary to punish. Now punishment in
the days of Cavignari not unusually meant waking up
some fine morning to find that before breakfast it
was either necessary to meet the Guides in a pitched
battle, or to submit quietly to the demands of Government,
and expiate the crimes committed. The
difficulty, from our point of view, was to place the
troops in the desired position, at the desired
moment, without previously informing the enemy of the<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
proposal. Failing this, either an ambush would be
prepared into which the troops might fall, thus
reversing the tables; or the whole village, men,
women, and children, flocks and herds, and all the
chickens that could be caught on short notice, would
migrate bodily for a few days, till the storm was
overpast. Then they would quietly return and
cheerfully resume the uneven tenor of their ways.</p>

<p>Now Paia was inhabited by Jowaki Afridis, and
he that findeth an Afridi asleep, when he ought to
be awake, is either a very astute or a very fortunate
person. Cavignari was a very astute person and a
match for the most wakeful Afridi. For instance,
the British troops that lay nearest to Paia were
those in garrison at Nowshera, and these, therefore,
were the most obvious ones to use. Being the most
obvious, it was at once decided that they were not
the troops to use. Therefore Cavignari refrained
from touching the Nowshera garrison, and called on
the Guides, who were sixteen miles further away,
and watching quite another frontier, to undertake
the business.</p>

<p>But here again a difficulty arose; the Guides on
their way would have to pass through Nowshera,
and as that place was doubtless full of spies, no
better result could be hoped for than by using a
Nowshera regiment direct. And there was yet
another difficulty: it was the middle of the hot
weather and a great many of the British officers of
the Guides, including the Commanding Officer, were<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>
away on leave; to recall them was to make the ears
prick up of every person, with a guilty conscience,
within a fifty mile radius.</p>

<p>But after all, military difficulties are possibly only
introduced by a beneficent Providence lest warlike
operations should become too easy; at any rate these
were in due course overcome, though it required
considerable ingenuity to do so. In the first place
the Guides were marched off, without a notion what
they were required for, or whither they were going.
All they knew was that they were plodding along
the Nowshera road on a very hot evening in August.
When well on their way, like a man-of-war at
sea they opened their sealed orders, and learnt
that in the vicinity of Nowshera they would find
a fleet of boats on the Kabul River. Embarking
on these they were to drop down that river, now
in flood, to its confluence with the Indus at Attock.
Here the flotilla was to be concealed while one
or two intelligent men were sent ashore to a place of
tryst, whither Major R.B. Campbell, the Commanding
Officer, and the other officers on leave, had been
ordered to arrive by a certain hour. Then, complete
in officers, the flotilla was to slip anchor again and
drop down the roaring flood of the Indus for another
twenty-eight miles to Shadipore, the local Gretna
Green, to judge from its name. It speaks highly
for the skill with which the operation was planned,
and the exactitude with which it was executed, to
record that it was carried out without a hitch. The<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>
Guides by a seventy-eight mile circuit now found
themselves south-east, instead of north, of the
objective, and the enemy were consequently taken
from a totally unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>Another of Cavignari's <i>coups</i> may perhaps be
given as illustrating not only his policy of smiting
hard, instead of palavering, but also the necessity
for strict secrecy. In 1878 when the Swat River
Canal, which has turned the desert plain of Yusufzai
into one great wheat-field, was under construction,
the more pestilential class of mullah, always on the
look-out for a cause to inflame Mahomedan fanaticism
against the English unbeliever, stirred up the tribesmen
to interfere with the work. A raid was consequently
made by them, and a lot of harmless
coolies murdered. The village of Sapri, just across
the border, was chiefly implicated in this outrage,
and Cavignari immediately demanded the surrender
of the murderers, as well as a heavy fine in money
wherewith to pension the families of the victims.
Secure in their fastness the men of Sapri sent
replies, varying from the evasive to the impertinent.</p>

<p>Cavignari said nothing more, but secretly warned
the Guides, who lay forty-three miles away, to be
ready to act. So carefully was the news kept
that a movement was on foot, that some of the
officers were playing racquets up to the last
moment, and were called from the court to march at
once. Captain Wigram Battye was in command, and
took with him the Guides' cavalry and a detachment<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>
of Guides' infantry mounted on mules. Marching all
night, the force arrived three miles beyond Abazai
and within eight miles of its objective, when it was
found impossible, owing to the difficult nature of the
country, to proceed further on horseback. All the
horses were consequently sent back to Fort Abazai,
and the dismounted cavalry and infantry went on
in the darkness over a most stony precipitous country.
By strenuous effort the village of Sapri was reached
and surrounded by daybreak. The villagers immediately
rushed to arms and prepared for a desperate
resistance, but the Guides were not to be
denied; they carried the place, killing many and
capturing the ringleaders, and nine others of those
implicated in the murders. Our own losses were
eight men wounded; while two received the Order
of Merit for conspicuous bravery in action.</p>

<p>Such were a few of the adventures of the Guides
during the twenty years which elapsed between the
Mutiny and the Afghan War.</p>

<h4>THE MASSACRE OF THE GUIDES AT KABUL, 1879</h4>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The annals of no army and no regiment can show
a brighter record of devoted bravery than has been
achieved by this small band of Guides. By their deeds
they have conferred undying honour, not only on the
regiment to which they belong, but on the whole British
Army.... The conduct of the escort of the Queen's Own
Corps of Guides does not form part of the enquiry entrusted
to the Commission, but they have in the course of their
enquiries had the extreme gallantry of the bearing of
these men so forcibly brought to their notice that they
cannot refrain from placing on record their humble
tribute of admiration.</p></div>

<p>So wrote the brave, bluff soldier, Sir Charles
Macgregor, as president of the Committee appointed
to enquire into the causes of the dreadful tragedy
which in a few hours ended in the massacre of Sir
Louis Cavignari and the whole of his escort.</p>

<p>When Cavignari, as minister and plenipotentiary
on behalf of the British Government, signed the
treaty of Gundamuk, one of the provisions of
which was that a British Embassy with a suitable<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>
escort should be established at Kabul, there were
many who, unable to forget the long-drawn history
of Afghan treachery, looked with grave apprehension
on the proposal. The Amir Yakub Khan, himself
but lately and unsecurely seated on the throne, was
not strong enough, it was urged, to uphold this new
departure, even were he honestly anxious to do so.
But against all opposition Cavignari placed his
commanding personality and strong prevailing will;
and by degrees he calmed not only any doubts the
Amir on the one hand may have expressed, but on the
other removed by convincing argument the objections
raised by the prophets of evil in our own camp.
Finally, to prove his unwavering confidence in the
practicability of establishing a British Embassy at
Kabul, he asked to be allowed in his own person to
prove the soundness and safety of the policy he
advocated.</p>

<p>The treaty of Gundamuk was signed in June
1879; but the Amir asked for a short respite, that
he might return to his capital to prepare quarters
for the Embassy and also accustom the minds of
his people to its proposed arrival. It was not
therefore till July 24th that Sir Louis Cavignari and
his escort arrived at Kabul.</p>

<p>This escort consisted of twenty-five, of all ranks,
of the Guides' cavalry, and fifty-two, of all ranks, of
the Guides' infantry under the command of Lieutenant
Walter Hamilton, who a few weeks before had
won the Victoria Cross at the action of Fattehabad<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>
The other Englishmen with the Embassy were
Surgeon A.H. Kelly of the Guides, as medical
officer, and Mr. W. Jenkins, as political assistant to
Sir Louis Cavignari.</p>

<p>The reception of the Embassy at Kabul was to
all seeming perfectly friendly, and even cordial.
Every honour was paid to it, and the assembled
crowds, though preserving the impassive mien of
Asiatics on such occasions, respectfully saluted
the British officers as they passed along. It had
been arranged that the members of the Embassy
and escort should take up their abode in quarters prepared
for them in the Bala Hissar, the celebrated
fortress which is indelibly connected with the name
of Kabul, and which completely dominates the city.
Here also were the Amir's palace and the houses
of many of his highest nobles.</p>

<p>For a month all went well. Cavignari paid
frequent visits to the Amir, and entered into long
and friendly converse with him. The Amir's
nobles and officials paid frequent return visits of
ceremony or friendship. The officers of the Embassy
rode out daily, morning and evening, to see the
country and surrounding places of interest, accompanied
always, however, by escorts of Afghan
cavalry as well as of the Guides. To encourage
friendly intercourse, they used to practise tent-pegging
and lime-cutting, and invited the Afghan
horsemen to join them. But, as showing how
curious are the workings of the Asiatic mind, it<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>
afterwards transpired that this apparently unexceptional
proceeding was looked on by many
with grave offence. The Afghan officers muttered
that this was mere braggadocio on the part of
the sahibs; that the sport was only to show
how they would spit and cut down the sons of the
Prophet, if they had the chance! To fathom such
depths of bigotry as this incident reveals is one of
the many difficulties which face Englishmen in Asia.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August Sir Louis Cavignari
received one or two direct warnings that all was
not well. It appears that in the ordinary course of
the relief of various garrisons several of the Amir's
Herati regiments were ordered from Herat to
Kabul, and Kabul regiments took their place.
These Herati regiments had seen nothing of the
late war: they had never crossed swords with the
British; and they were filled with the insensate
pride and confidence in their own prowess which
abysmal ignorance could alone account for. As
they marched through the streets of Kabul they set
up, at the instigation of their officers it is said, loud
cries of insult and abuse of Cavignari by name, of
the British Embassy, and of the whole detested race
of Feringhis. When this was told to Cavignari he
merely laughed and replied: &quot;Curs only bark, they
do not bite.&quot; In a broad sense he was right, for if
British officers had always lain down wherever
stray curs were moved to yelp, the British Empire's
outer frontier of to-day would be the cliffs of Dover.<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>
But a much more weighty warning came from an
undoubted well-wisher, an old retired native officer
of our Indian army, and a firm friend of the envoy.
His warning said that a plot was afoot; that the
cupidity of some had been appealed to by stories of
large treasure in the Residency, while the fanatical
hatred of others had been secretly fanned; that it was
well therefore to be on guard. A warning coming
from such a friendly quarter was doubtless duly
weighed and duly allowed for; but after all, what
could a peaceful Embassy do but trust to the honour
and integrity of the friendly Power whose guest it was?
To show the smallest sign of distrust by attempting,
for instance, to place a merely residential set of
buildings, completely commanded all round, into a
state of defence, was only to court disaster. What
could the British Ambassador in Paris do against a
brigade of troops unrestrained by the French
Government? What could an escort of seventy-five
men, however brave, do against thousands,
and tens of thousands, of armed men? Cavignari
therefore took the bold course, which British officers,
before and since, have taken. He sat quietly, and
with good and brave heart faced the coming storm,
if come it must; but greatly confident that it might
split and roll by on either side.</p>

<p>In the end, by sad mischance, a small matter, and
one quite unconnected, directly or indirectly, with
the attitude of the British Embassy, caused the storm
to burst with sudden and uncontrollable fierceness.<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>
The already half-mutinous Herati regiments were,
as was not unusual in those days, very much in
arrears as regards their pay. For months they had
received none, and were, perhaps naturally, in an
angry and sullen mood. The finances of the State
were in a chaotic condition, the treasury at low ebb,
and credit had receded to a vanishing point. After
staving off the day of reckoning as long as possible,
the welcome news reached the Herati troops that
they were to receive their pay in full next morning,
September 3rd, at the treasury in the Bala Hissar.</p>

<p>Assembling there early, they soon learnt to their
disgust and indignation that they were only to
receive one month's pay, a miserable pittance to men
long in want. On the smouldering embers of
mutiny someone wilfully, or from mere expediency,
threw the spark: &quot;Go to the British Embassy and
demand pay; there is lots of money there.&quot; The
idea caught like wildfire, and the whole mass of
soldiery dashed off to the Embassy, situated only a
few hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Here the ordinary routine of the day was going
on. It was eight o'clock, and Cavignari, just returned
from his morning ride, had not yet bathed or changed
for breakfast. Hamilton and Kelly had been out
to see that the grass-cutters were at their work
on waste land, and not interfering with private
rights, and were now probably strolling down the
line of troop-horses seeing to their feeding and grooming.<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>
Jenkyns was doubtless within, reading or
writing, and waiting for breakfast. The cavalrymen
were about amongst their horses, and the
infantry either on guard or taking their ease. On
this peaceful scene suddenly burst a torrent of infuriated,
half-savage soldiery, yelling for Cavignari,
yelling for money, shouting curses and threats. At
first they acted like mere Yahoos; they hustled and
mobbed the Guides, shouting with rough humour,
&quot;Well, if we can't get money we'll get something,&quot;
and then began untying horses to lead them away,
stealing saddlery, swords, or anything that lay about.
Then came a shot and silence; then another and
another, five or six in all, by whom fired no one
knows; and then the battle began,&mdash;four British
officers and some seventy of the Guides, against
countless thousands!</p>

<p>Nor was the vantage of position with the British,
for they could not possibly have been more unfavourably
situated for defence. The Residency consisted
of a collection of mud and plaster buildings, of which
the principal was the abode of the British officers.
The others included the rows of huts that formed
the barracks of the escort, servants' houses, and
stables; outside, and enclosed by mud walls, were
spaces in which were picketed the horses of the
cavalry, and which formed courtyards to the Residency
and men's barracks. Residential quarters of
this description, given time to loop-hole and barricade
them, would form fairly good defensive cover, except
against artillery; but unprepared for defence they<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>
are mere death-traps. To add to the untenable
nature of the position the Residency was completely
commanded from several directions, and especially
from a high flat-roofed house only eighty yards
distant. The roofs of the Residency buildings were
also flat, but made untenable by these commanding
positions, except in one small portion where a low
parapet, such as is often found on Eastern roofs,
gave some slight protection.</p>

width="378" height="541" /></div>

<p>After those first few shots there seems to have
been a pause, while the mutinous troops rushed
off to their camp to fetch arms and ammunition.
During this brief respite Cavignari sent a message
to the Amir, who was in his palace only a few
hundred yards distant, informing him of the unprovoked
attack, and claiming the protection due
to a guest of the nation; while Hamilton hastily
collected his men, and made such dispositions for
defence as were possible. Then above the dust and
din and rush of hurrying feet outside rose, clearer
and stronger as hundreds of throats joined the
swelling sound, <i>Y&#257;r Chary&#257;r</i>, the war-cry of the
great Sunni sect of Mahomedans. They were coming
in their thousands frenzied with fanaticism, and
thirsting deep for Christian blood. On the other
side, in calm and steadfast readiness, stood three
score and ten of the Guides, men of an alien race,
and some even brethren of the besiegers, but all
filled with high resolve and stern determination to
stand by their British officers even unto death.<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></p>

<p>Sir Louis Cavignari, soldier when diplomacy ceased,
was the first to seize a rifle, and, lying prone
on the flat exposed roof, with quick precision, one
after the other, shot dead four leaders of the assault.
But raked as he was from the higher positions, a
splintered bullet hit him in the forehead, and he had
to be taken below to have his wound dressed. Yet
undaunted, when the first shock passed, he must have
risen again, for an eye-witness from a neighbouring
house declares he saw four sahibs charge out at the
head of their men, and one of these must have been
Cavignari. And that was the last of the fight for
that brave soul, for the only further glimpse was
that of a hurrying soldier, who saw him laid on a
bed, with his feet drawn up, his hand to his head,
and the doctor at his side.</p>

<p>This was all early in the day, perhaps before
ten o'clock, and from this time forth the whole
burden of defence lay on a young subaltern of the
Guides, Walter Hamilton. Yet he was not alone,
for sharing his glorious toil, and rising to the heights
of heroism, was Jenkyns, a man of peace, bred not
to war or the sword, and Kelly, physician and
healer, but no fighting man.</p>

<p>And now in addition to the heavy fire from the
house-tops the mutineers bored loop-holes through
the compound walls, and through these, themselves
protected, poured a murderous fire into the devoted
building. Covered by this fire, escalading ladders
were run forward at a dead angle, and in a moment<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>
the roof was reached, and the small remnant of
Guides, six or seven in all, still manning the little
parapet were driven below. After them, gallantly
enough, the besiegers rushed down the steps; but
there they met their fate, for, turning fiercely on
them, the Guides killed many, and drove the
survivors back to the roof. It was at this time that
the first signs of fire were noticed, whether intentionally
ignited by the storming party, or accidental,
is not clear, though later conflagrations were
undoubtedly intentional.</p>

<p>But though the fight had now waxed stronger and
stronger for five hours, and though nearly one-half
of the garrison were killed or wounded, though the
British Envoy lay dead or dying, no thought of
surrender occurred to the stout hearts within.
Only, for the third time that morning, was an
attempt made by letter to remind the Amir of his
sacred obligations as a host and sovereign of a
friendly Power. On this occasion the bearer selected
was Shahzada Taimus, a Prince of the Sadozai dynasty,
but a plain trooper in the ranks of the Guides'
cavalry. The two preceding letters had been sent,
one by the hand of an old pensioner of the Guides,
slipped through an unguarded postern, but not seen
again and supposed to be killed; and the second by
a Hindu, who was indeed killed before the eyes of
the garrison in his brave attempt to get through.</p>

<p>The third letter was written by Mr. Jenkyns, and
handed by Hamilton to the Shahzada, a quiet<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>
unassuming man, to take to the Amir. A forlorn
hope indeed faced the brave fellow, as he looked
forth through a crevice at the yelling, shooting,
cursing crowd, surging round on all sides. To open
a door was instant death to himself and others, for
a shower of bullets would have greeted his exit.
The postern was now surrounded, and gave no hope
of escape. There remained only the roof, and this
means of escape Taimus decided to attempt.
Crawling cautiously up, he found this bullet-swept
area temporarily deserted, and creeping along it
peered over the end. There he saw, only some ten
feet beneath him, a furious crowd, many hundreds
strong, and those nearest the wall busy digging a
hole through it into the building.</p>

<p>Well, if he had to die, it was the will of God; he
would fight his way through, or fall sword in hand.
Standing up in full view, for a second the observed
of all observers, armed to the teeth, he calmly
jumped into the jaws of those baying wolves. The
shock of the fall was unwillingly broken by the
astonished forms of those on whom he fell, and
before they could grapple with him he was pushing
boldly through the crowd. But the odds and press
were too great for him, and after a brief close scuffle
he was for want of elbow-room overpowered and
disarmed. Many shouted &quot;Kill him! Kill him! he
is a Cavignari-ite!&quot; But above the uproar, holding
his hands above his head, Taimus made himself
heard. &quot;Peace! peace!&quot; he cried. &quot;I undoubtedly<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>
eat the salt of the Sirkar, but I am alone and
disarmed, a Mahomedan amongst Mahomedans,
and the bearer of a letter to the Amir. Kill me if
you like, but yours be the shame and disgrace.&quot;
As he spoke, amidst the crowd of angry, scowling
faces he saw a friend, a man of influence and standing;
at his word the crowd gave way, and battered,
bleeding, and closely guarded, Taimus was taken
before the Chief. But help was now out of the
Amir's power, as he sat bemoaning his fate in the
women's apartments. He could give no succour
he said, but he gave orders for Taimus to be
detained in a place of safety. To finish the story of
Shahzada Taimus: while confined there a havildar
of the mutineers was brought in with a bullet in his
back, and in his agony he besought Taimus to
extract it. This the Shahzada, though no surgeon,
succeeded in doing with a pocket-knife, and so
grateful was the mutineer that when night fell he
gave him his uniform and helped him to escape; and
eventually, after many adventures and by the use of
many disguises, the brave fellow reached India in
safety.</p>

<p>But to return to the Residency. <i>Jemadar</i>[1] Mehtab
Sing, one of the two native officers of the Guides,
was now dead, and Kelly's whole time was occupied in
attending as best he could to the wounded, of whom
there were now twenty or thirty. There remained<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>
in the fighting line only Hamilton, Jenkyns, Jemadar
Jewand Sing, and some thirty of the Guides. The
whole interior of the building was full of dead and
dying, enemies and friends, the atmosphere made
still more oppressive by the smoke of powder, and
by the more deadly peril of creeping incendiarism.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>Jemadar</i>, a native commissioned officer, next in rank to the
<i>subadar</i>.</p></div>

<p>At this juncture, loud and exulting shouts proclaimed
that fresh heart had been given to the
besiegers by the arrival of some new reinforcement.
The cause was self-apparent; two guns were being
run by hand into position at the gateway barely
one hundred yards away. Two guns, neither then
nor now, could face the open within a hundred yards
of armed infantry who could freely use their weapons.
But here was a different case. Driven by the storm
of fire all round into rooms without loopholes, and
incapable of affording either offensive or defensive
fire, the Guides could only get snapshots here and
there as occasion offered.</p>

<p>By a curious coincidence the story of those
newly-arrived guns was told with almost faithful
accuracy, in the brief testimony of a witness who
was nearly three miles away. He said: &quot;We
heard the big guns fire twice, and then there was
silence for some time; then they fired once or twice
more; and then, after a long interval, one or two
more shots. Perchance, seven or eight shots
altogether were fired.&quot; What to the distant hearer
were impressive, unaccountable pauses, were on the
scene of action filled with the bravest incidents.<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>
Cooped up as they were with a murderous artillery
firing point blank into them at one hundred yards
range, and spreading not only death and destruction
amongst wounded and unwounded alike, but still
further aiding the conflagration, which had by now
taken well hold of the buildings, yet still stout of
heart the Guides girded up their loins to meet the
new encounter.</p>

<p>Dr. Kelly left his wounded, and Jenkyns, the
young civilian, took again a sword and pistol, and
with the boy Hamilton as their leader, and with
twelve staunch and true men of the Guides behind
them, they opened the door. Then charging forth,
they quickly crossed the bullet-swept courtyard, and
fell with fury on the amazed gunners and the
crowd behind the wall. Shooting, thrusting, and
slashing, they killed or routed every man about the
guns, and seizing them tried to drag them back.
But here their strength was too small, though great
their heart, and though they swung the guns round,
and pulled them a few yards, they could not get
them away. The little band was falling fast, right
out in the open as it was; and at last the overwhelming
tide returned and drove them back with
the loss of half their numbers. Dr. Kelly, too, must
in the sortie have received his mortal wound, for
though he struggled back with the rest, he was
never again seen alive. <i>Requiescat in pace</i>: physician
and soldier, he died a hero's death.</p>

<p>Again the furious crowd surged up to the guns,<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>
recaptured them, slewed them round, and laid them on
the door. Then came the second salvo heard by
the distant listener; and again, scarce taking breath,
Hamilton made preparations for his new attempt.
&quot;Do you stand here and here; and you two, there
and there; and all of you shoot for all you're worth
at the gunners, while I and the rest again charge
out and capture the guns,&quot; he said. &quot;And I come
too,&quot; said Jenkyns.</p>

<p>Then a second time they threw open the door,
and a second time those two young Englishmen at
the head of the faithful few charged out on the guns.
But for Jenkyns the glorious end had come, and
sword in hand he fell, some seventy paces out, a lasting
honour to the great Civil Service of India. Yet
on went Hamilton and his dwindling band, and
taking no denial, stayed not by bullet nor sword nor
bayonet, again captured the guns. And then began
again the dreadful heart-straining struggle of desperate
men set to a task too great. Again with
splendid effort they dragged the guns a few yards,
and again the great returning wave engulfed them,
and fighting foot by foot the Guides were again
driven back.</p>

<p>And now the flames had got strong hold of the
buildings, and here and there the roofs fell in, and
dead and dying were entombed together. So
the few survivors driven from end to end found last
refuge in the <i>hamam</i>, or bath, which, being below
the surface of the ground and built of solid brick,<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>
gave welcome shelter. But even so death was but
a question of hours or minutes, and neither Hamilton
nor his men were of the sort to sit tamely down to
wait for it. Taking rest for awhile from the exhaustion
of seven hours of this Homeric struggle, the undefeated
Hamilton again laid his plans. &quot;Now two
or three,&quot; said he, &quot;will fire from here, so as to try to
keep down the fire on our assaulting party, while the
rest dash out again. Arrived at the guns, I alone
will face the enemy, while all of you, paying no heed
to the fighting, will harness yourselves to one gun
and bring it in. We shall then, at least, have one gun
less against us, and may perhaps be able to use the
captured one in defence. Then, in the same way,
we will again charge out, and get the other gun.&quot;
&quot;Your Honour speaks well, we are ready,&quot; said his
men.</p>

<p>This was the fourth sortie Hamilton had led that
day; the first with all four Englishmen in a line,
the second with three, the third with two, and now
alone. Over six feet in height, splendidly made,
lithe and strong, with all the activity of youth, expert
with sword and pistol, he was a noble specimen
of the British officer, and none more fit than he to
stand in the deadly breach. Out then they went and
acted on the plan arranged. For a third time those
fateful guns were captured, and then alone to stem
the fierce assault stood Hamilton, while his men
laboured at the gun; but the odds were too great,
and the gallant subaltern, after killing three men with<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>
his pistol and cutting down two more with his
sword, was himself borne down. And so fighting
died as brave a young heart as ever did honour to
the uniform he wore. Swarming over his body, the
mutineers recaptured the gun and again drove back
the remnants of the forlorn hope. Hamilton lay
where he fell close to the gun, till darkening night
settled down on the dreadful scene. But when,
next morning, a witness passed that way, he
mentions that the brave young fellow's body was
laid across the gun. Perchance it was the kindly act
of a friend, or perchance the rough chivalry of one
who had watched his heroic deeds.</p>

<p>It might be thought that a day so full of great
deeds, of patient courage, and unshaken loyalty
could, as the sun sank slowly down, produce no
further spark from those exhausted, starving few.
But it remained for the evening hour to produce,
perhaps, the brightest flash of all.</p>

<p>It was apparent to all the besiegers, fighters or
spectators, that one by one all the sahibs had been
killed or sore wounded, and that now none remained
to lead their men. At intervals during the day
loud voices, as of those in command, had shouted to
the garrison of Guides: &quot;We have no quarrel with
you. Deliver over the sahibs, and you shall all go
free, with what loot you can take. Be not foolish
thus to fight for the cursed Feringhis against your own
kith and kin.&quot; But for answer all they got was
fierce showers of bullets, and fiercer still the staunch<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>
defenders cried: &quot;Dogs and sons of dogs, is this
the way you treat your nation's guests? To hell
with you! we parley not with base-born churls!&quot;</p>

<p>And now, again, when all the Englishmen were
dead, the voices cried: &quot;Why fight any longer?
Your sahibs are killed. Save yourselves, and surrender,
before you are all killed. We will give you
quarter.&quot; Left in command was Jemadar Jewand
Singh, a splendid Sikh officer of the Guides' cavalry,
and not one whit behind his British officers in
brave resolve. He deigned no word of answer
to the howling crowd without, but to the few
brave survivors within, perhaps a dozen or so,
he said: &quot;The Sahibs gave us this duty to
perform, to defend this Residency to the last.
Shall we then disgrace the cloth we wear by
disobeying their orders now they are dead?
Shall we hand over the property of the Sirkar, and
the dead bodies of our officers, to these sons of
perdition? I for one prefer to die fighting for
duty and the fame of the Guides, and they that will
do likewise follow me.&quot; Then, as the evening
closed, went forth unhurried the last slender forlorn
hope. The light of the setting sun fell kindly on
those grim and rugged faces, out of which all anger
and excitement and passion had passed away: they
were marching out to die, and they knew it. One
last glimpse we have of their gallant end.
From a window hard by an old soldier pensioner,
himself a prisoner, saw, and bore witness, that the<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>
leader of those pathetic few, fighting with stern and
steadfast courage, killed eight assailants before he
himself, the last to fall, was overborne.</p>

<p>And so staunchly fighting they died to a man,
that gallant group,&mdash;died to live for ever. But round
them lay heaped six hundred dead, as silent witnesses
of twelve hours' heroic fight. The night fell,
and darkness and the silence of death succeeded
the strife of a livelong summer's day.</p>

<p>With that wise statesmanship for which the
British Government may claim its share, a national
memorial was raised at Mardan to these deathless
heroes, and on it is written: <i>The annals of no army
and no regiment can show a brighter record of devoted
bravery than has been achieved by this small band of
Guides</i>.</p>

<p>Yet another scene in the tragedy remains to
be told. It is a cold bleak day in early winter.
On one side stand the blackened, bullet-riddled
ruins of the Residency, much as we saw them last.
To the left, drawn up as a guard, is a long double
line of British soldiers with, bayonets fixed.
Behind them, covering every coign of vantage, every
roof and wall, are crowds of Afghans, silent,
subdued, and expectant. In the centre, in an open
space, stands a little group of British officers, one of
whom holds a paper from which he reads. Facing
the ruined Residency is a long grim row of gallows;
below these, bound hand and foot and closely
guarded is a row of prisoners. A signal is given,<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>
and from every gibbet swings what lately was a man.
These are the ringleaders in the insensate tragedy,
who, brought to justice by the strong resistless
power of British bayonets, hang facing the scene
of their infamy, for a sign throughout the length and
breadth of Asia of the righteous fate that overtakes
those who disgrace the law of nations.</p>

<h4>THE AFGHAN WAR, 1878-80</h4>


<p>The Afghan War of 1878-80 lives chiefly in the
memory of all as connected with the rise to fame of
one who has since earned a place in English history
with Marlborough and Wellington. And coupled
with his name remains indelibly engraved the great
historic march from Kabul to Kandahar.</p>

<p>Though they took no part in that celebrated march,
being so reduced in numbers by the stress of war
after two years' arduous campaigning that fresh regiments
took their place, yet the Guides look back
with the greatest pride to having once served under
Lord Roberts, and to having earned the kindly praise
of this great Captain. To this day grey-bearded
old warriors speak with quiet pride and affection of
their fighting days with &quot;Roberts Sahib&quot; at Kabul;
and many an old eye kindles and bent back
straightens as they salute his picture in the mess.
Some, too, will remember the exact place and date on
which he shook hands with them, and congratulated
them on some brave deed, as he pinned the star for
valour on their breasts.<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></p>

<p>It is given to few men to gain the affection and
soldierly respect of all, but Roberts possessed the
two great merits in the eyes of the simple Indian
soldier. He was always kind and considerate,
though firm as a rock, and always brave: kind
with the kindness which is never weary of watching
over the welfare of all, never forgetting a friend however
humble, and always remembering those little
soldier courtesies which count for so much; brave
not only with the bravery that wins the Victoria
Cross, but which, stout of heart, looks clear and undaunted
through the dark storm of a winter like that of
1879 at Kabul; and still burns bright when at seventy
years of age he goes forth at his Queen's behest to
turn back the dark tide of defeat in 1899, and bring
back victory to her standards.</p>

<p>To give an instance of this magnetic influence,&mdash;one
day long after the Afghan War, Lord Roberts, then
Commander-in-Chief in India, was passing the camp
of the Guides, riding quietly along, when the sentry
on the quarter-guard, an old soldier, recognised him
in the distance, and shouting as in duty bound,
&quot;Guard, turn out!&quot; added unofficially, but louder
still, &quot;Roberts Sahib is coming.&quot; The words
spread like lightning down the long lines of horses
and rows of tents; and with one accord each man
dropped his work at the magic name and dashed
to the head of the camp to see their old leader
and friend: it was no question of Commander-in-Chief,
it was only their old comrade Roberts Sahib.<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>
Need it be recorded that when his old soldiers heard
that in the day of trouble Lord Roberts had gone
to South Africa, they remarked with quiet confidence,
&quot;Ah! now all will be well.&quot;</p>

<p>For the Guides, serving as part of the force
under the command of the brave and chivalrous
leader of light horse, Lt.-General Sir Sam Browne,
K.C.B., V.C., the Afghan War opened with the
operations resulting in the capture of the formidable
fort of Ali Musjid, which bars the entrance to
the far-famed Khyber Pass. Sir Sam Browne was
an old Colonel of the Guides, and to meet again
in the field was the meeting of old comrades and
friends. Like Roberts, he knew how to use them,
and how to get the best out of them; and
the glowing words of his despatches show they
served him well.</p>

<p>In the plan of operations for the capture of Ali
Musjid one brigade was to attack in front, one in flank,
and one by a wide <i>d&eacute;tour</i> through the mountains was
to cut off the retreat. In this operation it fell to the
Guides to accompany General Tytler's column, which
was the one destined, after a long night march through
the mountains, to drop down in rear of the fort.
The column was greatly delayed owing to the difficulty
of the country, great mountains of eight
thousand feet high intervening; but Jenkins with the
Guides and 1st Sikhs pushed on, and by their timely
arrival broke the back of the desperate resistance met
by the frontal attack. No Afghan or Pathan can stand<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>
the strain of being taken in rear; a <i>sauve qui peut</i> becomes
at once the order of the day. Most of the
enemy fled through the mountains, but a regiment
of regular infantry took the road through the pass
and was captured by Jenkins and his men. Next
came a squadron of cavalry, and these bold fellows
determined to make a dash for liberty. Scattering
therefore and riding at a break-neck gallop many got
through, though many lay dead and wounded on the
ground; and then, out of the cloud of dust and smoke
might be seen, calmly riding at a foot's pace, a solitary
trooper. A perfect hailstorm of bullets was falling about
him, not the tiny bullets we now use, but great
one ounce Snyder bullets, such as would knock over
an elephant; but though nearly eight hundred rifles
were in action, the serene horseman appeared not
the least discomposed, and except for a defiant wave
of his sword he rode quietly on.</p>

<p>Then Jenkins, struck with the admiration of one
brave man for another, sounded the <i>cease fire</i>; and
in the dead stillness that followed the Colonel's
orderly shouted down to the horseman to ask him
who he was, and why he thus courted death. &quot;Oh,
brother,&quot; shouted the orderly, &quot;who art thou and
whence comest and whither goest?&quot; &quot;I am
Bahaud-din Khan,&quot; replied the horseman, &quot;and I
come from Ali Musjid, which the Feringhis have
taken, and I follow those sons of pigs, the Kasilbash
Horse, who you saw pass in such a hurry just now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Sahib says,&quot; shouted the orderly, &quot;that<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>
surely you must be mad thus to walk your horse
through a heavy fire like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not mad, tell the Sahib,&quot; replied the Afghan,
&quot;but fearing no man; and I shook my sword at you,
and your hundreds of rifles, to show that I cared not
that much for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By Jove, he's a brave fellow!&quot; said Jenkins;
&quot;tell him to come up and have a talk with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By all means,&quot; was the cheery reply; and
dismounting quietly, the man tied his horse to a
bush, slipped his sword into its scabbard, and strolled
up the hill.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, now tell me all about yourself,&quot; was
Jenkins's greeting.</p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing much to tell. I live in Kabul
and belong to the Kasilbash Horse, and my father
was a soldier before me. But he was a brave fellow
like myself; we are no mis-begotten apes, like those
sons of perdition who fled just now. They are all
cowards and runaways, and no fit company for a
warrior.&quot;</p>

<p>Jenkins liked the look of the man, and his courage
was beyond doubt, so he said cordially: &quot;You're a
fine fellow and I like you. Will you take on with
the Guides?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; said the free-lance without a
moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>So there and then, on the field of battle, Bahaud-din
Khan, late of the Kasilbash Horse, joined the
Guides, and was made a non-commissioned officer<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>
on the spot. For two long years, through the many
ups and downs of the campaign, through much
severe fighting and many a hardship, he did good
and valiant service. It was only when the war
was over, and the corps was nearing India on
its downward march, that Bahaud-din Khan began
to lose his reckless devil-may-care bearing; he
seemed sad, and dispirited, and out of sorts altogether.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, what ails you, my man?&quot; said Jenkins one
day as he chanced across him on the march.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, Sahib; I am very happy in the service
of the Queen, and I feel it an honour to serve in the
Guides.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, why look so doleful? One would
think you had lost your best horse, or broken the
sword of your ancestors on the head of a buffalo,&quot;
laughed Jenkins.</p>

<p>&quot;The truth cannot be hidden from you, Sahib, so
I will tell it,&quot; ingenuously replied Bahaud-din Khan.
&quot;My comrades tell me that down at Mardan they have
to do riding-school and drill, and all that sort of
thing. Well, I don't think, Sahib, that is quite in
my line. Give me as much fighting as you like, but
I'm too old a soldier to go bumping round a riding-school.
Therefore, with your Honour's kind permission
I think I will take my leave, and return to
Y&#257;ghistan, the land of never-ending conflict.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By all means,&quot; said Jenkins; &quot;no man stays in
the Guides against his will. You are a free man
from this moment.&quot;<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></p>

<p>And so, very near the same spot where he had
taken service on the field of battle, Bahaud-din Khan
quietly took his discharge, and rode off, like a
knight of old, to place his sword at the service of
any who wanted it. &quot;But riding-school, God forbid!&quot;
he muttered as he went.</p>

<p>It is not intended to follow the Guides through all
the phases of the Afghan War, but only to tell the
story of some of their gallant adventures. One of
the earliest of these was at the little battle of
Fattehabad, where Wigram Battye was killed, and
Walter Hamilton earned the Victoria Cross.[1] A
small force consisting of portions of the 10th Hussars,
Guides' cavalry, 17th Foot, forty-five Sikhs, together
with a battery of horse-artillery, were sent on from
Jellalabad, as an advance force to clear the road to
Kabul. About twelve miles out, at the village of
Fattehabad, General Gough[2] was suddenly
threatened in flank by a great gathering of Afghan
tribesmen.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] Here again I have had to depart from strict chronology.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p>[2] Afterwards General Sir Charles Gough, V.C., G.C.B., etc.</p></div>

<p>Acting on the principle that in dealing with
Asiatics it is always wise, whatever the odds,
to attack, instead of waiting the onslaught, the
General moved out rapidly with the cavalry and
horse-artillery, and ordered the infantry to follow
as quickly as possible. Getting in touch with the
enemy, the horse-artillery came into action, but
their fire, good and accurate as it might be, was not<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
sufficient to stay the determined advance of large
bodies of bloodthirsty and fanatical gh&#257;zis. The
General, therefore, ordered the cavalry to charge, the
two regiments acting independently under their own
commanders.</p>

<div><a name="pg124" id="pg124" /></div>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/jp124.jpg"
alt="A Trooper of the Guides' Cavalry"
title="A Trooper of the Guides' Cavalry"
width="563" height="406" /></div>

<p>Major Wigram Battye was commanding the
squadron of the Guides' cavalry launched to the
attack, but ere he had proceeded a few hundred
yards a bullet hit him in the left hip, and the
squadron, under Hamilton, swept on, leaving him
still in the saddle, though in great pain and
supported by his orderly.</p>

<p>Then happened one of those strange fatalities
which brings the Kismet of the Mahomedan into
close touch with the Providence of the Christian.
Hamilton and the whole squadron galloping every
second into more imminent danger remain unscathed.
The solitary sore wounded horseman, walking his
horse behind them, had that day come to the end of
God's allotted span; and as he walked yet another
chance bullet pierced his chest, and he fell to rise
no more; the second of the Battyes to die on the
field of honour, in the ranks of the Guides.</p>

<p>A touching proof of the affection and respect
which his men had for him was most affectingly
illustrated after the battle. There were, as in all
armies, ambulance-bearers, whose duty it is to carry
in litters the dead and wounded. For fear of desecration
it was decided to send back the dead for
burial to Jellalabad and beyond, and a litter was<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>
sent for Wigram Battye's mortal remains. But the
rough warriors whose soldierly hearts he had won
would allow of no such <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>. &quot;Ambulance-bearers
may be right and proper for anyone else,&quot;
they said; &quot;but our Sahib shall be carried by us
soldiers, and by no one else.&quot; And so reverently
they lifted the body of their dead comrade, and
through the hot spring night carried it on the first
stage towards the sweet spot in Mardan where the
brothers Battye lie at rest.</p>

<p>But the silver lining to this dark cloud of loss
was the prowess of the young subaltern and the
squadron that had fallen to his charge. &quot;Take 'em
on, Walter, my boy,&quot; were his leader's last words;
and right manfully did he obey them.</p>

<p>The plain over which they were advancing was
somewhat undulating, covered with loose stones, and
intersected here and there by more or less formidable
nullahs. Across this not very promising cavalry country,
Hamilton made good way, and was now close
enough to the enemy to give the orders, &quot;Gallop,
Charge!&quot; With the wild yell which so often, before
and since, has struck chill to the heart of an enemy,
the Guides dashed forward, the ground scouts checking
back for the squadron to come up to them; but
just as contact was imminent, a warning signal came
from one of these that there was impassable ground
in front. Here was a dilemma! Large masses of the
enemy firing heavily close in front, an obstacle impassable
for cavalry between, the guns uncomfortably
threatened close by, and the infantry still some way<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>
off! Happily, however, it takes a good deal to stop a
brave young Irishman with such men behind him.
A second or two brought them to the obstacle, and
sure enough it was no cold-blooded chance; a sheer
nine foot drop into the dry bed of a stream, and
opposite, with only a few yards interval, another sheer
cliff, and on top of that an exulting and frenzied
enemy! Without a moment's hesitation Hamilton
jumped into the gulf, and after him, scrambling,
sliding, jumping, anyhow and nohow, like a pack of
hounds, streamed his fierce following. Like hounds,
too, hot on the trail, they tarried not a moment there,
but scattering up and down the nullah singly,
or in clumps of two or three, found egress somehow.
And then came death, and the Prophet's Paradise,
to many a brave soul. From here and there, from
front and right and left, by ones and twos, by threes
and fours, charged home the gallant horsemen;
and at their head, alone with his trumpeter, rode
Hamilton. So rough and determined an onslaught
would shake the nerves of even disciplined troops;
but undrilled and undisciplined levies, however
brave individually, cannot hope to stand the fiery
blast of determined cavalry charging home. And
so the great crowd broke, and for four long miles
the pursuit continued, till man and horse alike were
worn and tired, and arms became too stiff to strike
or parry, and steeds yet willing staggered to a standstill.<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></p>

<p>In this brilliant charge the enemy lost four
hundred men, while the squadron of the Guides lost
twenty of all ranks and thirty-seven horses. To
Walter Hamilton was awarded the Victoria Cross,
and to six of his men the Order of Merit, for conspicuous
gallantry where all were gallant.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Leaving many months of intervening history, we
come to a notable feat of endurance, which threw a
much needed reinforcement into Sherpur during the
siege in December, 1879. The Guides were then strung
along the lines of communication towards Jellalabad,
but, on receipt of the serious news from Kabul, were
at once concentrated forward towards the Jugdullak
Pass, the scene of the massacre of our army in the old
Afghan War. Hastening forward to the summit of
the Lataband Pass, Jenkins got into communication
by heliograph with Sir Frederick Roberts (as he
then was), and learnt that reinforcements were
urgently required. This was quite enough for the
Commander of the Guides; he at once decided to
make an effort to cross the thirty-six miles of mountainous
country that intervened, and to fight his
way single-handed through the great hordes of
Afghans who were encircling Sherpur. Leaving
the whole of their baggage, no mean sacrifice during
an Afghan winter, and loading the mules with all the
ammunition that could be carried, the Guides set
cheerfully forth on their venture.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how often sheer boldness succeeds<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>
in warfare; here was a small body of troops marching
forty miles <i>en l'air</i> through the enemy's fastnesses,
and at the weary end unknown thousands blocking the
way. With scarce a halt, horse and foot plodded on
and on, till evening came and darkness fell, and
still they marched along the dimly marked track.
Near midnight the lights of Kabul and Sherpur
became closely visible, and the crucial moment had
arrived. But &quot;by the kindness of God,&quot; as the
ressaldar-major piously remarked, the night was
very cold, Kabul lies six thousand feet above the sea,
and a warm hut is better than an open field; and
in fact, to make a long story short, the Afghans
were keeping no watch on the road by which the
Guides came, and thus the whole corps marched
swiftly through the enemy's lines without firing a
shot or losing a man. In Sherpur they were warmly
welcomed by Sir Frederick Roberts and many old
comrades, for, as at the siege of Delhi, the boldness,
swiftness, and assuredness of their arrival added
heartening and encouraging effect quite out of proportion
to the numerical addition to the strength of
the garrison.</p>

<p>During the next two days the Guides' infantry
took part in the great assaults on the Takht-i-Shah,
and the Asmai heights, with the 72nd and 92nd
Highlanders; and in these Captain Fred Battye
was dangerously wounded, and Captain A.G.
Hammond[1] was awarded the Victoria Cross. In<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>
Sir Frederick Roberts's despatch the latter incident
is thus recorded:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Another officer who greatly distinguished himself on
this occasion was Captain A.G. Hammond, Corps of Guides.
He had been very forward during the storming of the
Asmai heights, and now when the enemy were crowding up
the western slopes, he remained with a few men on the
ridge until the Afghans were within thirty yards of them.
During the retirement one of the men of the Guides was
shot; Captain Hammond stopped and assisted in carrying
him away, though the enemy were at the time close by and
firing heavily.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">[1] Now Colonel Sir Arthur Hammond, V.C., D.S.O., K.C.B.</div>

<p>No less than twelve men of the Guides also
received the Order of Merit for conspicuous gallantry
on this occasion.</p>

<p>As no result sufficient to counterbalance the
serious losses incurred by making these repeated
attacks on the enemy's position appeared to be
obtained, Sir Frederick Roberts determined to
alter his tactics, and to allow the enemy in their
turn to hurl themselves against our defence. For
a whole week, though in immensely superior numbers,
the enemy could not steel their hearts to
attack the fortified enclosure of Sherpur, where
Roberts's small force lay entrenched. But on the
evening of December 22nd certain information was
received that a grand attack would take place at
dawn, and that the signal for the advance would be
a beacon which would be kindled on the Asmai
heights, just above the village of Deh-i-Afghan.</p>

<p>Strict watch was kept that night in the British<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>
lines, and after the keen anxiety of the long vigil
a feeling almost of relief passed through the staunch
defenders when, about half-an-hour before daylight,
the beacon shone forth that waved to the attack
the followers of the Prophet, to wipe the hated
infidel from the face of God's earth.</p>

<p>In the intense stillness of the frosty winter's
night the swift shuffling tramp of thousands of
sandalled feet could be heard coming across the
open. The attack was evidently aimed at the eastern
face of Sherpur, rightly considered the weakest point
structurally, but stoutly and steadfastly held by the
Guides. Where such immensely superior numbers
are concerned it is not safe to allow them to get
too close, or by sheer weight they may beat
down a thin line of rifle-fire. The Guides consequently
opened a heavy fire into the darkness in
the direction of the advancing masses, thereby making
known to all and sundry that the surprise, as a
surprise, had failed. This with undisciplined troops
was alone enough to disconcert the whole operation;
the enemy, instead of advancing, halted, and, taking
refuge in the villages, awaited the break of day.</p>

<p>So soon as it was light they opened a heavy
but badly aimed fire on the Guides, but showed no
disposition to assault. At last, after some delay and
evidently under the urgent haranguing of their priests
and leaders, a mass of warriors some five thousand
strong was collected under the shelter of the villages
to make another effort. But so steady and accurate<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>
was the fire of the Guides, that even these brave
fanatics feared to face the open, and the attack
melted away. Sir Frederick Roberts, with the
eye of the born general seizing the right moment,
launched his cavalry and artillery in counterstroke
and pursuit, till when the sun set that night fifty
thousand of the chivalry of the Afghan nation had
been swept from sight and hearing, and nothing
but a vast solitude remained where teeming thousands
stood lately.</p>

<p>Thus collect, and thus disappear, the great yeomen
armies of Afghanistan. To-day they are not; to-morrow
they are assembling in their thousands from
the four quarters of the compass; a few days, and
they have melted away like snow. The explanation
is simple enough. The fiery crescent goes forth,
summoning the faithful, every man with his arms
and ammunition and carrying in his goatskin bag
food enough to last him for a week. Commissariat
or Ordnance Departments there are none; thus as
each soldier finishes his food or his ammunition,
or both, he hies him home again for a fresh supply;
perhaps he returns, and perhaps he has had enough
fighting for the present, and does not. And so is it
with all the fifty thousand.</p>

<p>The Guides did not see any more serious fighting
till April, when, together with a wing of the 92nd
Highlanders under Major White,[1] and two guns of<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>
F.-A. Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, they fought
a gallant little action with about five thousand of
the enemy at Charasiab near Kabul. Jenkins, who
was in command, heard shortly after midnight that
about two thousand of the enemy were bivouacked
within five miles of the camp, but that they had no
immediate intention of attacking. An old soldier like
the Commander of the Guides, however, takes nothing
for granted, and orders were at once issued for the
Guides' infantry to stand to their arms an hour before
daylight, while the Guides' cavalry sent out patrols
to feel for the enemy at crack of dawn. And well
was it that these timely precautions were taken, for
as day broke the enemy's masses were seen advancing
to the attack. To give elbow-room, and also
as a preparation for all eventualities, Jenkins struck
his camp, and ordered the baggage to be stacked
behind a convenient mound; then sending back
word of how matters stood to Sir Frederick Roberts,
he with his little force prepared to face the onslaught.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] Afterwards Field-Marshal Sir George White, V.C., G.C.B., &amp;c.,
&amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Seizing such knolls and points of vantage as existed,
his battle-line took the form of a semicircle,
with one company of the 92nd Highlanders and two
companies of the Guides in reserve. The enemy,
now increased to three thousand warriors, steadily
advanced, and with great bravery planted their
standards in some places within one hundred yards
of the British line; but that last one hundred yards
they could not, by all the eloquence of their leaders
or the promises of Paradise from their priests, be<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>
induced to cross. Nor was it only the Afghans who
felt the tightening strain; it was an anxious moment
for the British, too, for given one slight slip, one
weakhearted corner, and the whole thin line might
have been swept away by the onslaught of those
fierce masses.</p>

<p>It was then that Jenkins used a curious and expensive,
but, as it proved, effective expedient. He
ordered the Guides' cavalry to mount, and, exposed
at close range to the enemy's fire, to patrol quietly
from one end of the line to the other, as a sort of
moving reserve; a demonstration, in fact, that even if
the enemy managed to break through the thin line
of the infantry at any point, it would only be to fall
on the dreaded swords of the cavalry. The behaviour
of the men during this trying ordeal was above all
praise; and indeed it requires high qualities of
nerve and courage to walk one's horse up and down
for a couple of hours under a hail of bullets, without
being able to return the compliment in any way.</p>

<p>The enemy's numbers had increased to five
thousand, and still Jenkins's little force held on
with dogged courage, and though it could not make
an inch of way, it refused to concede one. It was now
past one o'clock, and the strain lay heavy on our men
after seven hours of this bull-dog business; when
the twinkle of the cheerful heliograph from Kabul
gave fresh heart to all, and almost immediately
afterwards the advance skirmishers of General
Macpherson's column came into view, and the<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>
situation was saved. Then, borne on the flood of the
reinforcements, Highlanders and Guides sprang
to their feet and dashed at the now flying enemy.
The cavalry and artillery, too, at last relieved of their
long and dangerous vigil, dashed off in pursuit, and
for four long miles they fell with relentless fury on
the scattered and demoralised foe.</p>

<p>This was the last fight which the Guides had in
the Afghan War. When Roberts and his gallant ten
thousand marched to Kandahar, they were sent back
to their hard-earned rest, after two years of incessant
warfare, with a casualty roll of two hundred and
forty-eight of all ranks and one hundred and forty-two
horses; and with five hundred recruits to
redress the balance.</p>

<h4>WAR STORIES</h4>


<p>Several months before the Afghan War
began the Guides were placed on guard at the
mouth of the Khyber Pass, and there occurred
an incident which illustrates the extremely delicate
problem accompanying the employment of Indian
troops in certain situations. In the ranks of the
Guides are men belonging to a great number of tribes
and nationalities, many of them enlisted from
amongst peoples whose territories lie outside the
British borders. It may so happen therefore, and
indeed does happen, that in the kaleidoscope of
events a man who has taken service and sworn to
fight the battles of the King finds himself called
upon to attack his own village, and possibly to raise
his rifle against his own kith and kin. Such a
situation naturally requires very careful handling.
It is of course absolutely necessary to maintain the
great principle, that a soldier is bound hand and
foot and in all honour to the service of his Sovereign,
and that no family or private ties must stand between<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>
him and any duty that service may call on him to
perform. On the other hand, without relinquishing
this principle, it is often possible, by a little tactful
and unostentatious redistribution of troops, to avoid
placing a soldier in so unenviable a position as
taking part in an attack on his own home. Sometimes,
however, this is impossible, as in the story
here related.</p>

<div><a name="pg136" id="pg136" /></div>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/jp136.jpg"
alt="Types of men in the Guides' Infantry"
title="Types of men in the Guides' Infantry"
width="579" height="387" /></div>

<p>The Guides were daily expecting orders to advance
into the Khyber Pass at the head of an army,
and would thus at the very outset be fighting against
some of the men's own relations and friends.
Amongst these men was a young Afridi soldier, who
was sore puzzled what to do. His own village lay
right in the path of the army, and only a few miles
distant; his relations and friends came daily to visit
him, urging him to take his discharge and return
to his own people before the war began. Was
anyone ever in a more awkward position?</p>

<p>On the very eve of the advance he made his
decision to stand by the colours, and gave a final
refusal to his relations. Yet even then opportunity,
combined with the ties of kinship, was too much for
him. It was his turn for sentry-go that night, all double
sentries, and, as is the custom, no two men of the
same class together. With our young Afridi on his
beat there happened to be a Gurkha, and that Gurkha
did a thing which not only hurled his comrade to
perdition, but brought himself to a court-martial.
His tent was close by and he said to the young<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>
Afridi: &quot;Hold my rifle a minute, while I fetch something
from my tent.&quot; In one second the whole of
that young Afridi's good resolutions failed him; the
struggle of weeks had been in vain. Two rifles in
his hand, not a soul near, the black night in front,
and beyond&mdash;his own village, and friends, and a
warm welcome! He stalked off into the darkness
and was lost for ever. Then came the sequel.</p>

<p>The British officers were at dinner in their mess
tent, when the havildar of the guard came running up
to make his report, and brought as witness the
erring Gurkha. The Colonel of the Corps at this
time was Colonel F.H. Jenkins, a man who had
learnt much from Lumsden, and had caught in many
ways the genius for dealing with wild warriors.
&quot;How many men of that man's tribe are there in
the regiment?&quot; sternly demanded Jenkins. After
reference to the company, it was found that there
were seventeen of them all told. &quot;Parade them all
here,&quot; said the Colonel; and they were duly
summoned, and paraded in line. &quot;Now take off
every scrap of uniform or equipment that belongs to
the Sirkar.&quot; Each man did as he was bid, and
placed the little pile in front of him, on the ground.
&quot;You can now go, and don't let me see your faces
again till you bring back those two rifles.&quot;</p>

<p>The Colonel perhaps hoped that they might overtake
the fugitive, overpower and secure him before
he had gone far; but if so he was disappointed, for
as day followed day, and week succeeded week, no<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>
news came of pursued or pursuers. The matter had
been forgotten; the vacancies had long since been
filled; indeed, two whole years had passed, when
one day there walked into Mardan Cantonment
a ragged, rough-bearded, hard-bitten gang of
seventeen men, carrying two rifles. It was the
lost legion!</p>

<p>Of those two years' toil and struggle, wounds
received and given, a stark unburied corpse here
and there on the mountain-side, days in ambush and
bitter nights of silent anxious watch, they spoke but
little. But their faces beamed with honest pride as
their spokesmen simply said: &quot;The Sahib told us
never to show our faces again until we found the
rifles, and here they are. Now, by your Honour's
kindness, we will again enlist and serve the Queen.&quot;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On another occasion, during the Afghan War, it
was a matter of considerable importance to ascertain
the temper of an important tribe, whose position and
territory threatened the left flank of the lines of
communication not far short of Jellalabad. For this
difficult and dangerous duty Duffadar Faiz Talab of
the Guides offered his services, well knowing the
great risks he was likely to incur, though, as the
event proved, he materially underrated them.</p>

<p>Dressed as an ordinary Pathan, with great flowing
white garments, a slatey blue puggery, and with a
dagger or two stuck in his cummerband, he sallied
forth one dark night, and laid up not far from camp.<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>
This precaution was taken so that not one of the
hundreds of pairs of sharp eyes in our own camp
should see him depart.</p>

<p>Next day he strolled on leisurely, and in the
course of the afternoon arrived at the chief village
of the tribe in question. In every Afghan village
there is a rest-house, or <i>serai</i>, for strangers, and
thither as a rule towards evening the village gossips
also find their way; the hospitable <i>hookah</i> is passed
from mouth to mouth, and in grave Oriental fashion
they set about picking each other's gossip-pockets.
&quot;And you, brave stranger, who are you?&quot; asked a
grey-bearded, sharp-eyed old man of Duffadar Faiz
Talab.</p>

<p>&quot;I?&quot; he answered readily; &quot;why, I have just left
those dogs of Feringhis (may God burn them in
hell!), where I took service for a short time, so
as to learn their ways, and their tricks of fighting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Sh&#257;hb&#257;sh</i> (bravo)!&quot; exclaimed the company;
&quot;and what are you going to do now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What am I going to do now? Why, fight the
accursed infidels, of course!&quot; replied the duffadar.</p>

<p>&quot;That is indeed fortunate,&quot; said the headman of
the village, &quot;for our spies tell us that the Feringhis
intend attacking us. We shall now be able to
make you the general of our forces, and since you
have been so wise as to learn the cunning strategy
of the infidels we shall of a surety kill them all, and
send their souls to hell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, certainly, if I am here,&quot; hastily mur<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>mured
Faiz Talab, adding as he regained his
composure and the Oriental art of fluently telling
the thing that is not true, &quot;but unfortunately I have
urgent business over the Khost, and cannot delay.
To-morrow at crack of dawn I must be on my
way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our kismet is indeed bad, but let the will of
God be done!&quot; was the pious rejoinder of the most
villainous-looking of the surrounding cut-throats.</p>

<p>Night having now fallen, and the lighting
arrangements of an Afghan village being limited to a
wood fire, travellers and villagers began one by one
to roll themselves up in their wadded quilts, and each
man, hugging his sword, dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>Just before dawn Faiz Talab was awakened by
someone rudely shaking him. &quot;Get up, oh indolent
one, the English are upon us, and we look to you to
help us to defeat them. Here, take this rifle and
these twenty rounds of ammunition, and come and
show us how best we may arrange our battle line.&quot;</p>

<p>Up jumped the duffadar, and hastily shook
together his sleeping wits. Here was a pretty
dilemma! Evidently something had occurred to
precipitate action on the part of the British, and it
had been found inexpedient, or perhaps impossible,
to wait for the receipt of his report. Meanwhile
the duffadar was in the exceedingly uncomfortable
position of him who finds himself between
the devil and the deep sea. As the chosen leader,
thus miraculously fallen from heaven on the eve of<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>
battle, he had become so important a figure that
it was impossible for him to take up a modest
position in the rear; indeed, a bullet through the
head would have been the immediate rejoinder to
any such suggestion on his part. Forced thus by
circumstance into the forefront of the battle, he
turned his back to the devil and stood forth to face
the deep sea, and the great waves of British soldiers
which surged across it to the attack.</p>

<p>&quot;The first thing to do,&quot; he shouted authoritatively,
&quot;is to take good cover, so that the bullets
and cannon-balls of the English cannot hit us; and
then, when they have expended their ammunition, we
will shout Allah! and charge them with the sword.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well spoken!&quot; was the cry, and the order
passed up and down the line.</p>

<p>Be assured that duffadar Faiz Talab did not
fail to appropriate the thickest and strongest wall in
support of his tactical scheme.</p>

<p>&quot;The next thing to do,&quot; yelled the unwilling
general, &quot;is to fire as rapidly as possible, so as
to frighten the English thoroughly, before we sally
forth and kill them.&quot; And suiting action to words
Faiz Talab fired off his twenty rounds with great
rapidity in the safest possible direction, and prayed
God that he had not hit one of his own comrades.
At the same time he added a perhaps equally potent
supplication, to the effect that his comrades might not
be so careless or inconsiderate in their turn as to
shoot him.<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></p>

<p>Having no more ammunition, Faiz Talab
hugged his wall closer than a limpet, and noticed
with growing satisfaction that ammunition was
running out all along the line. On the other hand,
as an inquisitive neighbour, with two bullets in his
puggery, pointed out, the English were advancing
very quickly, apparently with plenty of ammunition,
and were just at that moment fixing bayonets.</p>

<p>&quot;Fixing bayonets!&quot; exclaimed one and all;
&quot;then it is indeed necessary that we should
depart, so that, by the grace of God, we may
be ready to fight with renewed vigour on another
day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is well spoken, brethren,&quot; said Faiz Talab,
and added with considerable pathos, &quot;but as for
me, I shall remain and die at my post.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, say not so!&quot; remarked one or two with
polite, but not very insistent interest.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing will persuade me to move,&quot; stubbornly
reiterated the duffadar, devoutly praying that no
one else would insist on sharing his bed of glory.</p>

<p>The English soldiers could now be heard talking
plainly, and one, speaking louder than the rest,
said, &quot;Cease firing, fix bayonets, charge!&quot; A
loud <i>hurrah</i>! sounded, and then Faiz Talab
found himself alone on his side of the wall.
That was all very well, but it was not of much
avail to have escaped so far, to end his days with
eighteen inches of a British bayonet through his best<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>
embroidered waistcoat. If it had been any Indian
regiment, or, better still, his own regiment, the
Guides, he could at once have secured safety by
declaring who he was. But with British soldiers,
none of whom would probably understand a word
he said, and all heated with the excitement of battle,
he might get the bayonet first and enquiry afterwards.
However, something had to be done; so up he
jumped and, holding up his hands, yelled, &quot;Stop!
stop! I am a friend of the British.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Ullo, 'ere's another bloomin' ghazi! 'ave at
'im, Bill!&quot; was the brisk rejoinder, in the familiar
tongue of a British soldier of the 17th Foot.</p>

<p>And &quot;'ave at 'im&quot; they most assuredly would,
had not a British officer arrived in the very nick
of time. &quot;He says he is a friend of the British,&quot;
the officer shouted; &quot;give him quarter till we find
out whether he speaks the truth or not.&quot;</p>

<p>So reluctantly they made Faiz Talab a prisoner,
temporarily postponing the pleasure of sending him
to join his numerous friends in the ghazis' Paradise.</p>

<p>But Faiz Talab said to the officer: &quot;May I see
you alone? I have something important to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; said the officer; &quot;but mind, one
of my men covers you all the time.&quot;</p>

<div>And when they drew apart, Faiz Talab took off
his shoe; under the lining was a little piece of
paper, which he handed to the officer, and on it
was written in English: <i>The bearer of this is
Duffadar Faiz Talab of the Guides: please give him
every assistance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F.H. Jenkins</span>, Lt.-Col</i>.</div>

<h4>THE ADVENTURES OF SHAH SOWAR AND ABDUL MUJID</h4>


<p>Many strange adventures have befallen individual
men of the Guides, and many a hairbreadth escape
have they had. It was only a few years ago that
the following adventures occurred.</p>

<p>An order reached regimental headquarters to
detail a cavalry soldier who could speak Persian, and
one stout of heart and limb, to accompany a British
officer on a mission of considerable danger and
uncertainty. He was to call at a certain house, on a
certain day, in Karachi, and to ask for the name of
Smith. Shah Sowar was the trooper selected, and
when he arrived at the place of tryst he was ushered
into the presence of Smith. Smith, however, was
not Smith at all, but somebody quite different; not
that it mattered much, for Smith was only his
Karachi name.</p>

<p>Next day, on board ship, he became the Sheikh
Abdul Qadir, on his way to Mecca or where not;
and from that moment commenced the troubles of
the redoubtable Shah Sowar. To anyone who has<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>
the least knowledge of Asia the extraordinary
difficulty which any European must experience in
disguising himself as a man of an Eastern race will
be apparent. By dint of living for years as Asiatics,
exceptional linguists like Vambery and Burton have
undoubtedly been able to pass unchallenged, but anyone
possessing qualities short of theirs must inevitably
be discovered a dozen times a day. The way we eat
and drink, the way we walk and sit, the way we wear
our clothes and boots, the way we wash,&mdash;every little
thing is absolutely different from the methods and
manners of the East.</p>

<p>These things Shah Sowar pointed out with much
politeness, and great persistency, to Sheikh Abdul
Qadir, late Smith. &quot;Be it spoken with the greatest
respect, but there would be less liability to the
unmannerly curiosity of strangers if the Cherisher
of the Poor wore his own clothes. Beautifully as
your Highness speaks Persian and Hindustani [his
Highness really spoke both indifferently] it would
be difficult for one of such commanding presence to
pass himself for any but an Englishman. English
officers are a race of princes; how then can they
disguise themselves as inferior folk?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't fret,&quot; replied Smith, <i>alias</i> Sheikh Abdul
Qadir; &quot;I am going to remain a prince all right;
for I propose passing myself off as a near relation of
the Amir, a refugee from Kabul.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As your Honour wishes,&quot; was the resigned
reply; but Shah Sowar saw big rollers ahead.<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></p>

<p>Arrived on the coasts of Persia (it matters not
where), Sheikh Abdul Qadir, Shah Sowar, and a
cook-boy landed as refugees from Kabul, on their
way to place their swords and services at the disposal
of the Shah of Persia.</p>

<p>In these days an officer with a Government
permit might probably travel, with a moderate
escort, in perfect safety throughout Persia; but at
that time a Government permit, and a small escort,
would merely have served to draw the unwelcome
attention of the hordes of robbers who infested the
country. For good and sufficient reasons our
friend Smith was required to pass through a certain
tract of very unsettled country on his journey, ways
and means being left to his own ingenuity.</p>

<p>As Shah Sowar had foretold, the first serious pitfall
was the question of language. When persons
of some rank are travelling it is customary for the
headman, or chief, to come and pay his respects
to them, when they are encamped near his village
or domain. It was after one such visit that the chief,
as he came out, called Shah Sowar to him and said:
&quot;Who did you say that your master is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Commander of the Faithful, his name is Sheikh
Abdul Qadir, a relative of the Amir of Kabul and a
refugee,&quot; glibly replied Shah Sowar, but inwardly
considerably perturbed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, with all respect,&quot; replied the chief, &quot;I
never heard anyone talk such bad Persian; he talks
just like an Englishman&quot;; and with that he departed.<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></p>

<p>Shah Sowar at once grasped what a narrow escape
they had had, for an Englishman found in that region
in disguise was a dead man. So soon therefore as
it was dark he persuaded his master to saddle and
move on a few miles, lest further reflection might
shed a light on the dim suspicions of the chief.
One bargain Shah Sowar made during that night
march, and that was that Sheikh Abdul Qadir
was henceforth to remain speechless, and leave
the rest to his own ingenuity and knowledge of his
countrymen.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards an occasion offered for
testing the new arrangement. Arrived at a somewhat
important town, a servant of the local chief
came to make enquiries about the new arrivals, in
order that the etiquette of visiting might be observed,
this etiquette ruling that the inferior should pay the
first visit. Here Shah Sowar at once took a high
hand, insisting that his master, from his princely
connections, held the higher rank and must be visited
first. &quot;But,&quot; he added in a confidential whisper,
&quot;my master is an extraordinary man; some days he
is as lively as a bulbul and laughs and talks with
everyone; on others he sits silent and morose and
will not utter a word. Be it spoken in confidence,
but I think he must be mad. At any rate, prepare
your master. If to-day happen to be one of his bad
days, then that is kismet and your master must excuse.&quot;
Having thus prepared one side, he placed a
bed across the end of the tent and asked Sheikh<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>
Abdul Qadir, late Smith, to sit cross-legged on it, to
glare fixedly and furiously into vacancy, and to
grunt at intervals, but on no account to utter a
syllable.</p>

<p>In due course the chief and his retinue arrived,
and were met with great politeness and many
salaams by Shah Sowar; but that worthy managed
to whisper in the chief's ear the sad intelligence that
this was one of his master's bad days, and that the
Evil Spirit was upon him. &quot;Nevertheless be
pleased to enter,&quot; he added aloud; &quot;His Highness
will be glad to see you.&quot;</p>

<p>The exceedingly restricted area of the tent prevented
a large assembly, but the chief, his
brother, and Shah Sowar managed to squeeze in
and squat down. After exchanging salutations the
chief gravely stroked his beard, and gave vent to a
few polite expressions of welcome. To these Sheikh
Abdul Qadir vouchsafed no reply beyond a grunt.
The chief glanced at Shah Sowar, and that excellent
comedian, assuming the ashamed look of one disgraced
by his master's rudeness, at once made a
long-winded and complimentary reply in the most
fluent and high-flown Persian. Then, before the
effect should be lost, he ordered in tea, and commenced
an animated conversation with the two
strangers, all parties absolutely ignoring, out of
politeness, Sheikh Abdul Qadir and his Evil Spirit.
Thus anxiously skating over the thin ice, Shah
Sowar at last, with a feeling of infinite relief, bowed<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>
out the visitors, charmed with his excellent
manners and quite unsuspecting that they had sat
for half-an-hour within two feet of a British officer.
When the time for the return visit came, Shah Sowar
went alone to make the readily accepted excuse that
his master was not in a fit state that day to fulfil
social obligations.</p>

<p>Thus the ready wit and resource of Shah Sowar
piloted the party through many dangerous waters, till
one day they chanced across a nomad tribe under a
venerable white-bearded chief, who could count a
thousand spears at his beck and call. The usual
visits of ceremony had been paid and tided over
somehow, and the travellers were resting during the
heat of the afternoon, when a confidential servant of
the White Beard came to Shah Sowar and said that
his master had sent for him. A peremptory call
like this boded no good, but by way of getting a
further puff to show which way the wind blew, Shah
Sowar assumed a haughty air. &quot;Peace be unto you,&quot;
he said; &quot;there is no hurry. I will come when I am
sufficiently rested, and have received permission
from my own master.&quot; &quot;Be advised by me, who
wish you no harm, to come at once, as the matter is
of importance,&quot; replied the messenger. &quot;Oh, very
well,&quot; grumbled Shah Sowar, feeling that trouble
was in the air; &quot;I will come.&quot;</p>

<p>When he arrived at the camp of the White Beard
he was immediately ushered into his tent, and there
found the old warrior seated cross-legged on a rich<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>
carpet, and gravely stroking his beard. &quot;Look here,
Shah Sowar,&quot; said he with soldierly directness, &quot;it
is no good lying to me. That is a sahib you have
with you. I have been to Bushire, and I know an
Englishman when I see him.&quot;</p>

<p>Shah Sowar was prepared for this, but, by way of
gaining time, he answered: &quot;Your Excellency's
cleverness is extraordinary; to lie to your Highness
would be the work only of a fool. Perchance my
master may be a sahib, but there are many nations
of sahibs, and why should this one be English?&quot;
&quot;Peace, prattler!&quot; sternly replied the old autocrat;
&quot;there is only one nation of real sahibs, and they are
English.&quot;</p>

<p>Shah Sowar, driven into a corner, stroked his
beard for some time under the rebuke, and then said:
&quot;I perceive there is no good trying to deceive so
great a diviner as you. I will speak the truth. My
master is an English officer travelling on business.
What then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What then?&quot; slowly replied the White Beard.
&quot;Why, I have sworn on the Koran, and before all
my tribe, to kill every Englishman I come across.
I fear no nation on earth but the English, and lest
they swallow me up, I have sworn to swallow them,
one by one, whenever I meet them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If your Honour has thus sworn there is nothing
else to be said,&quot; answered Shah Sowar. &quot;But I
have one petition to make, and that is to give us till
the morning before we die.&quot;<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></p>

<p>&quot;Your petition is granted; but why say 'we'?
I shall not kill you, for you are a Mahomedan, and
a Persian, and shall join my horsemen,&quot; said the
White Beard.</p>

<p>&quot;When the Sahib dies, I die also,&quot; was the brave
reply. And with that Shah Sowar hurried back
to tell the bad news to his master. Arrived at their
little camp, his worst forebodings were confirmed,
for a strong detachment of the White Beard's men
guarded it on every side.</p>

<p>All that afternoon the prisoners racked their
brains to find a way of escape, and hope seemed to
die with the setting sun. Then Shah Sowar arose
and said, &quot;I will have one more try to see what
can be done&quot;; and gaining permission, he went
over again to the chief's camp, and asked for
another audience. The old man was at his prayers,
and Shah Sowar devoutly and humbly joined in.
When they had finished he asked for a private
audience, as he had something of importance to
say.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what is it?&quot; said the White Beard when
they were alone.</p>

<p>&quot;It is this,&quot; gravely replied the Guides' trooper,
&quot;and be pleased to listen attentively. When you
bade me speak the truth this afternoon, I spoke fearlessly
and at once. I acknowledged that my Sahib
is an English officer. Hear now also the truth, and on
the Koran I am prepared to swear it. This English
officer whom you propose to kill is the bearer of an<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>
important letter to the Shah of Persia, and I swear
to you by Allah and all his prophets that, should harm
befall him, for every hair of his head the Shah will
kill one of your horsemen. Make calculation, oh
venerable one; has not the Sahib more than a
thousand hairs on his head? I have spoken.
Now do your worst, but blame not me afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is very unfortunate,&quot; said the much perturbed
chieftain. &quot;Have I not sworn before all my
people? How then can I now spare this Englishman?
My kismet is indeed bad; I can see no
road of escape.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That I can show you,&quot; said Shah Sowar, &quot;and
for that am I come again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say on, I am listening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have sworn before your people that you
will kill the Englishman at dawn; but there is no
reason why the Englishman should not escape
during the night. To save your face I will heavily
bribe one of the sentries, and we will escape on foot
leaving everything behind. Thus you will get all
our horses, and mules, and tents, and all that we
have. And in the morning you can say 'It was
the will of God,' and march away in the opposite
direction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have spoken well,&quot; said the chief after
deep thought. &quot;I will do as you wish; it is the will
of God.&quot; Then he added aloud, and with anger so that
all might hear: &quot;I have spoken; at dawn the accursed
Englishman shall die, and I will shoot him with<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>
mine own hand. Praise be to Allah, and Mahomed
the prophet of Allah.&quot;</p>

<p>So Shah Sowar went back to his Sahib and explained
the plan of escape. And as soon as all was
still the three slipped noiselessly out of the camp, past
the bribed sentry, and, setting their faces to the south,
toiled on, hiding at intervals, till they had placed
well-nigh forty miles between themselves and the
camp of the White Bearded Chief.</p>

<p>Then his heart broke through the stiff reserve of
the Englishman, and he embraced his gallant comrade,
and said: &quot;You and I are no longer master and
servant, sahib and trooper; you have saved my life
and henceforth we are brothers. What can I do for
you to show my gratitude?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, Sahib, except to tell my Colonel that I
have done good service and upheld the name of the
Guides.&quot; And the only other thing that Shah Sowar
would accept was a watch to replace that which he
had lost in the flight; and on it is inscribed, <i>To my
faithful friend Shah Sowar in memory of</i>&mdash;(and
here follows the date of their flight).</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Amongst the explorers who have gone forth from
the Guides, taking their lives in their hands and
barely escaping, was one Abdul Mujid. This fine
specimen of the trained adventurer was working
through a hitherto unmapped and little known
country, when one evening he came to a small village,
and made his way as usual to the travellers' serai.<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>
There also, as is not unusual, he found assembled,
besides wayfarers like himself, the headman of the
village and two or three other residents, smoking
and chatting. They made room for Abdul Mujid,
and with the outwardly polite insistence of the
Oriental asked his business, whence he came, and
whither he was going.</p>

<p>While our good friend the Guide was spinning
such romances as seemed good unto him, to account
for his presence in this secluded valley, a small boy
came and squatted down at his feet, to lose not a word
of the story. And sitting there, like a boy, or a
magpie, he picked up one of the shoes which Abdul
Mujid had slipped off as he took his seat and began
to examine it curiously. This perfectly childish act
by chance caught the wandering glance of the headman,
and as he looked at the shoes, and then up at
the fine strapping fellow who owned them, a sudden
thought occurred to him. &quot;Those are very like
soldiers' shoes,&quot; he said in a hard, suspicious voice; &quot;I
have seen them wearing the like in Peshawur.&quot;</p>

<p>Abdul Mujid was considerably taken aback, for
it had never occurred to him that in these wild
parts he might chance across anyone who had
travelled far enough to know the difference between
a soldier's and any other shoe. However, his ready
wit came to his service, and with scarce a pause
he replied quietly: &quot;Yes, I bought them in one of
the border villages from a sepoy on leave,&quot; and then
turned the conversation on to less dangerous ground.<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>
But he saw he was suspected, and any moment
might find him seized and searched. It was too
late to move on to another village; indeed to
attempt to do so would only serve to confirm
suspicion, and the moment he had passed the sacred
portals of hospitality he would have been instantly
followed and cut down.</p>

<p>Shoes in themselves are not enough to hang a
man, but a prismatic compass assuredly is. In a
Pathan country murder, rapine, and cattle-lifting are
comparatively venial offences, little more indeed than
instances of lightheartedness; but to draw a map of
the country is worse than the seven deadly sins
rolled into one, and short will be the shrift of him
who is caught in the act. It therefore seemed to
Abdul Mujid only a wise precaution to get rid of his
prismatic compass as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>With this end in view he walked over to the well,
as if to get a drink of water, and, as skilfully as he
could, dropped the compass down the well. But
fate was against him that day; sharp ears heard the
hollow splash, and sharp voices immediately demanded
what he had thrown down the well.</p>

<p>&quot;Only a stone off the coping,&quot; replied Abdul
Mujid.</p>

<p>&quot;You lie!&quot; yelled the headman. &quot;You are a spy
of the accursed British Government, and out of
your own mouth will I condemn you. Here,
Yusuf, get a stout rope and let the boy down the
well; there isn't more than half a yard of water<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>
in it, and we will soon see whether the stranger
lies or not.&quot;</p>

<p>Here was a nice predicament! But Abdul Mujid
faced the peril like a man, and held to the faint
hope that no one would recognise the instrument
even if they found it. It was a false hope. In a
few minutes up came the boy, gleefully flourishing
the damning evidence, and there was not one who
doubted what it was. Probably in the circumstances,
whatever the article it would have had the same
effect, for the case was already prejudiced.</p>

<p>&quot;Now then, thou son of a burnt father, what
sayest thou?&quot; screamed the headman. &quot;Thou art
a spy as I said, and shalt surely die. <i>Hein!</i> what
sayest thou?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak truth, father,&quot; replied the sepoy. &quot;I
am making a map for the British Government; but
this is only a little portion of it, and if you object I
will leave out this part altogether, and then there
can be no cause of offence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go to,&quot; sneered the headman, &quot;I shall take
a much more effective way of closing the matter by
killing you at once. Here, Yusuf, bring my gun,
and you, young men, see that this misbegotten
Kafir does not escape.&quot;</p>

<p>So Yusuf went off for the gun, and Abdul Mujid
turned his face towards Mecca, and said the evening
prayer. Then hope came to him from above and
he said to the headman: &quot;Be not hasty; I am a
follower of the Prophet as also are ye. Give me<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>
till the morning that I may make my peace with
Allah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is well said,&quot; interposed a bystander; &quot;he is
alone and has no chance of escape. Let us therefore
not kill him like a dog or an infidel; but let him
make his peace with Allah, and then in the morning
he shall die.&quot;</p>

<p>And so it was settled, and Abdul Mujid was
bound hand and foot, and laid upon a <i>charpoy</i>[1]; and
beside him, with a drawn sword at his side, lay down
the man who was to guard him, the two on the
same bed.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>Charpoy</i>, the common bed of the country.</p></div>

<p>All night long Abdul Mujid lay racking his brains
for a means of escape, and found none; and then
just before dawn came Allah to his help. Nudging
his bedfellow hard, the sepoy said: &quot;Awake,
sluggard, I wish to go and pray.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, go and pray,&quot; grumbled the guard.</p>

<p>&quot;Go and pray!&quot; replied Abdul Mujid; &quot;how can
I go and pray with my arms and feet tied? Can I
make the salutations and genuflections ordered in
the Koran while thus strapped up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I suppose you can't,&quot; answered the guard.
&quot;But you also don't suppose I am going to leave
my warm quilt on this bitterly cold morning to
guard you while you pray?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is not the least necessary,&quot; said Abdul
Mujid; &quot;if you will free one hand I will spread my
own carpet by the bed, and you can thus guard me<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>
without getting up, for my legs are tied, and therefore
I cannot escape. Assuredly Allah hath spread
the cloak of stupidity and sloth over this fellow,&quot;
he said to himself, as his janitor rolled over, and
lazily muttering &quot;Oh very well, anything for a little
peace,&quot; to the sepoy's intense delight fumblingly
untied one of his hands.</p>

<p>What followed was like a streak of lightning from
heaven. In one flash Abdul Mujid had seized the
naked sword, and the slothful sentry, before he could
draw another breath, lay dead to all below; in
another flash he had severed his bonds, and was
making the best of his way across the fields. Nor
did he halt, night or day, till weary and exhausted
he fell down and slept by the first milestone that
proclaimed that he was again in British territory.</p>

<p>Nearly a year afterwards a motley band of
ruffians might have been seen walking up the
main road at Mardan towards the Court-House.
It was a deputation from a far-away country come
to discuss matters with the political officer. At
their head on a sorry steed rode the chief person:
at the roadside by the post-office, idly watching the
party file past, was a man of the Guides; and
when the eyes of those two, the Guide and the man
on the pony, met, they both remembered the village
well, and one recollected how nearly it was his last
night on earth.</p>

<p>&quot;May you never grow weary,&quot; said the Guide in
the polite formula of the road.<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></p>

<p>&quot;May your riches ever increase,&quot; came the stock
reply.</p>

<p>&quot;And how about that man on the charpoy?&quot;
bawled Abdul Mujid.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he's all right, having by the mercy of God
a thick skull,&quot; came the reply.</p>

<p>&quot;Sh&#257;hb&#257;sh! come and feast with me when your
business is finished. I will make preparations at
the cook-shop at the head of the bazaar.&quot;</p>

<p>And so ended in peace and jollification an adventure
which at one time looked much more like cold-blooded
murder and a string of vendettas.</p>

<h4>THE RELIEF OF CHITRAL</h4>


<p>The anxiety of great events in South Africa has
somewhat dimmed the recollection of our smaller
troubles in previous years; but perhaps there are
some who can recall the feeling of tense suspense
that enthralled the nation during the spring of 1895.</p>

<p>Two hundred miles from our borders in an
inaccessible, and hitherto almost unheard of, valley
lay besieged a little force of Indian soldiers, under
the command of a sprinkling of British officers.
Between the beleaguered garrison and the nearest
support lay great chains of the highest mountains in
the world, still covered thick in snow, rivers deep
and strong and of incredible treachery, roads that were
mere goat-tracks carried along the face of precipices,
or following a shingly bed between stupendous walls
of rock, many made doubly perilous by craftily
prepared stone-shoots. To add to the difficulties of
the task climatic variations of extraordinary diversity
had to be overcome, for troops might one day be
freezing on a pass twenty thousand feet above the sea,<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>
and on another sweltering under the tropical heat of
the valley below; days passed under the scorching
rays of an Eastern sun might be succeeded by nights
without shelter under storms of cold and pitiless
rain. Finally one of the two relief columns had to
pass through two hundred miles of unmapped and
unexplored country, inhabited by armed fanatical
tribes fiercely opposed to the passage of the troops
while the other, weak in numbers, and marching <i>en
l'air</i> hundreds of miles from any support, was a
veritable forlorn hope.</p>

<p>It speaks highly for the mobilisation arrangements
of the Indian Army that within eleven days a corps
of all arms, twenty-five thousand strong, had derailed
at a little roadside station, and under Sir Robert Low
had marched forty-two miles to the frontier, fought a
decisive action, and forced the first barrier of mountains
on its road to Chitral. Unhappily it does not
lie within the region of this story to relate how the
gallant forlorn hope under Colonel Kelly, overcoming
stupendous difficulties, made its way to the
succour of the sore beset garrison, but history has
already done justice to that gallant achievement.
Here, in a regimental narrative we are naturally
restricted to the column to which the Guides
belonged.</p>

<p>On the opening day of the campaign it fell to the
Guides' infantry to turn the right flank of the enemy,
having, supported by the 4th Sikhs, captured after
five hours' hard fighting a commanding mountain, to<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>
this day called the Guides' Hill, which completely
dominated and turned the Malakand position. It
was next day, however, that a weak squadron of the
Guides' cavalry had the opportunity of performing
a notable service. After the passage of the Malakand
the road runs down between gently sloping
spurs into the Swat Valley. At the end of one of
these spurs was a rocky outcrop, which would now
be called a <i>kopje</i>, and holding this was a regiment
of Dogras, while in support, under cover, lay the
best part of a brigade of infantry. Just under the
tail end of the kopje stood dismounted a squadron,
fifty strong, of the Guides, under Captain Adams
and Lieutenant Baldwin. The neighbouring hills
were covered with dense masses of the enemy,
firing heavily, and severely pressing the Dogras.
Evening was drawing on and the day too far advanced
for the British force to commit itself to any very
forward or extended operations.</p>

<div><a name="pg162" id="pg162" /></div>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/jp162.jpg"
alt="Non-commissioned Officer and Trooper of the Guides' Cavalry"
title="Non-commissioned Officer and Trooper of the Guides' Cavalry"
width="574" height="413" /></div>

<p>At this moment a temporary non-combatant, the
well-known Roddy Owen, then acting as a newspaper
correspondent, in the course of doing a little
scouting on his own account discovered a large
force of the enemy, estimated at two thousand men,
committed to the open with the evident intention of
enveloping the left flank of the Dogras. This news
he at once communicated to Captain Adams, and
that officer rode back a short distance to take the
General's orders. Just as he was returning,
Lieutenant Baldwin, seeing that the moment to<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>
strike had arrived, boldly took the initiative and
set off on his gallant venture. The effect was
little short of magical, and established irrevocably
the <i>moral</i> of cavalry and the <i>arme blanche</i> for
the rest of the campaign. The moment the little
squadron of the Guides appeared round the corner,
yelling the well-known war-whoop of the Indian
soldier, the whole of the forward movement of the
enemy's masses ceased. There was a moment of
hesitation, another of delay, and then the whole body
broke and fled, fiercely pursued by the cavalry. The
execution done was considerable, but greater still was
the moral effect. From that day forth a mounted man
was a power in the land.</p>

<p>The Relief Force now pushed across the Swat
River, and over the Saram range of mountains, and
came in due course to the formidable Panjkora River,
formidable not so much from its size, or breadth, but
from its great rapidity and uncertainty. In a single
night, fed by melting snow from the higher levels, it
would rise from twelve to fourteen feet. And this
is exactly what happened at a critical moment, when
it fell to the honour of the Guides to avert a serious
disaster.</p>

<p>Before the Relief Force could cross it was necessary
to bridge the river, and this was done at a narrow part.
Directly it was completed the Guides were ordered
across to hold the bridge-head, and thus cover the
passage of the main body next morning. That the
defence might not be a passive one only, Lieutenant-<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>Colonel
Fred Battye, who was commanding, was
ordered at dawn to push out, destroy all the neighbouring
villages, and turn the enemy out of all positions
from which they had been operating during the
construction of the bridge, and from which they could
harass the passage of the force. During the night a
freshet came down, the river rose fourteen feet,
and the newly finished bridge was swept away.
The Guides were thus isolated on the far bank,
but getting no orders to the contrary, and very
possibly thinking that to remain inactive was to
invite unwelcome attention to their condition,
Colonel Battye decided to adhere to the original
programme. Therefore leaving two companies at
the site of the broken bridge, he at six in the
morning moved out to drive back the enemy's
outposts, and destroy such villages as were troublesome.</p>

<p>Up to nine o'clock there was no opposition to speak
of. Colonel Battye then formed the five companies of
the Guides, which constituted his force, into three
small columns, and was proceeding to carry out more
extended operations, when, from the high ground
now occupied, dense masses of the enemy, afterwards
officially estimated at from seven to ten thousand,
were seen rapidly approaching his right flank. It
had evidently become known to the enemy that the
bridge was broken, and that the Guides were cut off
by an impassable river from all support. The
matter was immediately reported by heliograph to<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>
Sir Robert Low, and orders as promptly sent for
the Guides to retire on the bridge-head.</p>

<p>It is on an occasion like this that the true fighting
value of a regiment shows itself. Great as
is the glory of those who, surrounded by comrades,
are borne on the tide of great events to victory, still
greener are the laurels that adorn the standards of
those who, amidst great tribulation and fighting
against overwhelming odds, keep untarnished their
ancient fame.</p>

<p>Before the anxious eyes of an army, so near yet so
powerless to help, the Guides commenced their retirement.
With the great mountains as an amphitheatre
the drama began to unfold itself before the
gaze of waiting thousands. At first so far away
were they, so few, so scattered, and clad to match the
colour of the hills, that only the strongest glasses could
make out the position of the Guides; but apparent
to the naked eye of all was the great straggling mass
which was falling with relentless swiftness, guillotine-like,
on the narrow neck of the communications with
the bridge. With cool intrepid courage, with a deliberation
which appeared almost exasperating to the
onlookers, Colonel Battye and his men took up the
challenge. Little parties of soldiers could be descried
slowly sauntering back, a few yards only, then
disappearing amongst the rocks with a rattle of rifle-fire.
Then back came more little parties of soldiers,
all seemingly sauntering, all with the long sunny day
before them. And after them bounded great waves<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>
of men in blue, and men in white, only to break and
stagger back before those little clumps of rock in
which the rearmost soldiers lay. &quot;Get back, get
back! Damn you, why don't you get back?&quot;
shouted the spectators on the eastern bank in
impotent excitement. But no word of this reached
the Guides on the slopes of the still far-off mountain-side;
nor would they have heeded had they heard,
for they had been born and bred to the two simple
maxims, &quot;Be fiery quick in attack, but deadly
slow in retirement.&quot; And so slowly back they came,
and in their wake lay strewn the white and blue
figures, all huddled up, or stark and flat.</p>

<p>The retirement now brought the regiment down
the spur of a lofty hill which forms the angle where
the Jandul River flows into the Panjkora. This
hill is to the south of the Jandul, while the
bridge-head was to the north. Thus to reach
their entrenchment the Guides had to retire
down the spur they were now on, and to cross the
Jandul.</p>

<p>It was now noon, and at about this time the
enemy's masses were seen to divide in two; one-half
keeping to the right, so as to support the attack on
the Guides, while the other column continued down
the Jandul, so as to cut the regiment off from its
bridge-head. Foot by foot (to the spectators it
seemed inch by inch) the different companies retired
alternatively, fiercely assailed on all hands, yet coolly
firing volley after volley, relinquishing quietly and<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>
almost imperceptibly one strong position, only to take
up another a few yards back.</p>

<p>At last the impatient spectators on the left bank
of the Panjkora had a chance of helping, for the
enemy were now within range of the mountain-guns,
and the steady and accurate fire of these greatly
relieved the pressure. At the same time the two
companies of the Guides in the entrenchment,
seeing that the enemy's left column was closing down,
moved out to check their advance, and to stretch
out to the rest of the regiment a helping hand.
The whole of the 2nd Brigade also lined their
bank of the Panjkora, and prepared with flank fire
to help the Guides, when they reached the foot of
the spur. Here it would have to cross several
hundred yards of level ground, on which the
green barley was standing waist-high, ford the
Jandul, about three feet deep, and then across
more open fields to the friendly bridge-head. This
naturally was the most difficult part of the operation,
and in executing it Colonel Fred Battye, the
fourth of the heroic brothers to be killed in action, fell
mortally wounded. He was, as might be expected
from one of his race, always at the point of danger
throughout the retirement, and as he crossed the open
zone among the last, a sharp-shooter at close range,
from behind a withered tree, fired the fatal shot.</p>

<p>It was on this open ground that the extraordinary
bravery of the enemy was most brilliantly shown.
Standard-bearers with reckless gallantry could be<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>
seen rushing to certain destruction, falling perhaps
within ten yards of the line of the Guides; men,
who had used up all their ammunition, would rush
forward with large rocks and hurl them at the
soldiers, courting instant death. Nothing could
damp their ardour, or check the fury of their
assaults. Even after the Guides had crossed the
river, and the enemy were under a severe flank
fire from the Gordon Highlanders and King's
Own Scottish Borderers, they dashed into the
stream, where each man stood out as clear as a bullseye
on a target, and attempted to close again. But
not a man got across, so steady and well directed
was the flank fire of the British regiments. This
welcome diversion enabled the Guides to complete
the retirement into their entrenchment at the bridge-head,
and there make rapid preparation for the
attack that must follow; for though the enemy had
lost six hundred men, their spirit was by no means
broken.</p>

<p>Reinforcements consisting of two companies of
the 4th Sikhs, and the Devonshire Regiment Maxim
gun, were sent across after much labour by means
of a little skin raft that only held two at a time.
The near bank was also <i>sungared</i> and held by the
2nd Brigade and the Derajat mountain battery,
which at eight hundred yards' range could fire over
the heads of those at the bridge-head. Several
officers of the Guides' cavalry also volunteered to<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>
cross over and help their comrades, for in a night
attack it was a matter of holding their own, covering
fire from the near bank being too dangerous
an expedient.</p>

<p>The Guides, who were now under that good and
cheery soldier Fred. Campbell, put out no picquets,
so as to keep clear the field of fire, and every man
slept, or sat awake, at his fighting station with his
rifle in his hand. The enemy could be heard close
by in large numbers, hidden by a fold in the
ground, and directly darkness set in they began
yelling and tom-tomming in the most approved
fashion. This was to work up any flagging spirits
that there might be, and to exalt the courage of
all, for two thousand chosen warriors, sword in
hand, lay ready in the standing corn, to make a
desperate dash at the given signal, which was
to be the first peep of the crescent moon over
the mountains, calculated for about midnight.
There was some warlike cunning in this, for when
a moon is about to rise every weary watcher is
looking for it during the last moments, and then
looking down again would find everything dark
as the pit's mouth by comparison. In those few
seconds the assailants meant to bound across the
short intervening space, and come to close grips
with the enemy who had staved them off all day
and half the night.</p>

<p>It was then that the use of one of the resources of
science stood the British in good stead, and probably
saved the lives of many hundreds. The officer<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>
commanding the Derajat battery, peering anxiously
through the darkness, and perplexed to know what
was happening, bethought him to throw a star shell
over the Guides' entrenchment, so as to light up the
ground beyond. The effect was magical. &quot;What
new devilment is this?&quot; exclaimed the brave but
ignorant tribesmen. And when another, and yet
another, came, they said: &quot;This is an invention of
the Evil One; it is magic, and will cast a spell over
us. We cannot fight against devils such as these.&quot;</p>

<p>And so those few harmless fireworks effected the
same purpose as a storm of shot and shell. All that
vast throng melted away, and only a few of the
braver sort held post till morning. But before going
they inflicted one great loss, mortally wounding
the gifted Captain Peebles, the only officer who knew
the working of a Maxim gun, then new to the army.</p>

<p>The remainder of the campaign was a matter of
a few days. How Kelly, with his gallant regiment,
the 32nd Pioneers, pushed on from the north,
overcoming stupendous difficulties; how a strong
force of levies under the Khan of Dir was thrust
on from the south; how Aylmer, the brave and
resourceful Sapper, working night and day threw
a suspension bridge of telegraph wire across the
Panjkora; how Sir Robert Low, crossing with
his whole force, fought a decisive and conclusive
battle at Mundah; and how thus, by a fine strategic
combination, worked from widely divergent bases,
Sir George White effected in the course of seventeen<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>
days the relief of the sore beset garrison of Chitral,
are recorded amongst the many and sterling achievements
of the army of India.</p>

<p>Amongst the trophies and standards brought down
by the Guides was a solid brass cannon of
tremendous weight captured at Mundah. In a
mountainous country where there are no roads, and
for a weight far beyond the carrying capacity of a
pack animal, there appeared to be no alternative to
leaving the gun behind. But rather than do this the
men volunteered to carry it themselves, and thus
twenty men at a time carried the gun while their
comrades carried a double load of arms and
ammunition. The gun now stands at Mardan near
the memorial to the officers and men who fell in
defence of the Kabul Embassy, and on it is
engraved in Persian the curious and bombastic
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It's mouth is open wide to eat.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What shall I call it? A gun or a serpent?</span><br />

<h4>THE MALAKAND, 1897</h4>


<p>As the officers of the Guides were sitting at
dinner on the night of July 26th, 1897, a telegram
was handed to Colonel Adams informing him that
the Malakand position had been attacked by overwhelming
numbers, that the garrison was with difficulty
holding its own, and asking him to bring up
his corps as speedily as possible to its succour.</p>

<p>Accustomed for decades to these sudden appeals,
the Guides' cavalry, bag and baggage, supplies,
transport, and all complete, were off in three hours,
and the Guides' infantry followed them. The march
was twenty-nine miles along the flat to Dargai, and
then seven miles rise and two thousand feet climb to
the summit of the Malakand Pass. For cavalry,
considering the time of year, it was by no means a
mean undertaking; for infantry it was one of the
highest achievement. To march thirty-six miles
under service conditions, in the most favourable circumstances
of weather, temperature, and training,
is a high test of endurance; but to do so when<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>
the muscles are enervated with heat, along a treeless,
waterless road, during the fiercest term of the
summer solstice, was a feat to secure the admiration
of every soldier. The march was accomplished
in sixteen hours, the first twenty-nine miles
being covered without any regular halt, and the last
seven miles up a mountain on which the blazing
afternoon sun was beating its fiercest. Yet not a
man fell out, and it is recorded by an eye-witness[1]
that as the regiment passed the quarter-guards, the
men came to attention, and answered the salute as
smartly as if just returning from a parade march.
The Guides of 1897 had borne themselves no
wit less worthily than the Guides of 1857 or the
Guides of 1879. To Lieutenant P. Eliott-Lockhart
belongs the honour of commanding the Guides'
infantry in this fine soldierly performance, and the
Distinguished Service Order worthily decorated him
for this and other gallant service. To arrive as a
reinforcement is to be welcome enough; to arrive
by exertions beyond the compass of calculation, in
time to afford assistance at the critical moment, is
the fortune of few. Yet thrice has this good
fortune smiled on the efforts of the Guides, at Delhi,
at Kabul, and at the Malakand.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>The Story of the Malakand Field Force</i>; by Winston Spencer
Churchill, Lieut. 4th Hussars. London, 1898.</p></div>

<p>Arrived, and without a moment to rest or
ease their belts, these weary, but stout-hearted
fellows went straight on outpost duty, that 27th of<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>
July, 1897, and spent the livelong night, not in
sleep, or even a quiet turn of sentry-go, but in a
desperate hand to hand fight with swarms of brave
and persistent warriors.</p>

<p>Piece by piece the officers heard the strange story
of the sudden rising. It appears that while the
officers of the Malakand garrison, in days of profound
peace, were playing polo down at Khar, a village three
miles away, the villagers came to them with a warning.
They said that a very holy mullah from Upper Swat
was coming down the valley with a large following
to attack the Malakand, and advised the officers to
get back to their defences as soon as possible; they
even assisted back the grooms with the spare ponies.
Yet these very same friendly villagers a few hours later
were caught in the frenzied flame of fanaticism, and
were charging with the most devoted bravery breastworks
held by troops commanded by the very
officers whom they had just helped to save.</p>

<p>Amongst the officers playing polo were Lieutenants
Rattray and Minchin, who belonged to the garrison
of Chakdara some seven or eight miles up the Swat
Valley. To return to their posts they had therefore
to pass right through the tide of armed men flowing
down the valley in great numbers. Yet as illustrating
the chivalrous nature of the wild hillmen, a
trait somewhat unusual amongst the more fanatical
Pathans, the officers were allowed to pass unmolested,
and indeed here and there a friendly voice
bade them make good speed home. The British<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>
officer's custom of being out and about doing something,
instead of sitting permanently at home studying
or playing chess, stood him in good stead on
this occasion, giving, as it proved, a good four hours'
warning in advance.</p>

<p>It was not till after ten o'clock at night that the
carefully planned attacks on the Malakand and Chakdara
were delivered simultaneously by great swarms of
tribesmen, with a resolution and bravery worthy of
the highest admiration. At the Malakand there
were many anxious moments, for the position was an
extended one, and, by the nature of the ground,
difficult for a small garrison to preserve from
penetration. It was a night of individual heroism,
a soldier's battle, where little knots of men under
their officers fought independently, and with undiminished
courage, though often cut off from all
communication. No less brave was the enemy, and
it was not until dawn that he reluctantly withdrew.
This was the first of five nights and days through
which the British garrison had to stand this stern
ordeal.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done when daylight made
concerted movements possible, was to contract the
perimeter of defence, so as to make it more
tenable by the number of troops available. The
original garrison was now augmented by the arrival
of the Guides, horse and foot. It was with
considerable reluctance that Colonel Meiklejohn,
who had himself been wounded by a sword-cut,<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>
decided on abandoning what was known as the
North Camp, a position some distance below and
isolated from the Malakand. This camp had been
established both to allow the cavalry and pack-animals
to be near water, of which there was scarcity
on the Malakand itself; and also for sanitary
reasons, so as to keep so large a number of animals out
of a restricted area. The abandonment of this camp,
necessary though it was, undoubtedly had an
extraordinarily heartening effect on the enemy. All
night they had fought desperately, and lost heavily,
without apparently gaining any result; but the
retirement of the troops from the North Camp,
besides leaving in their hands the large tents
and heavy baggage of all sorts, impossible to move
at short notice, showed that the garrison also had
felt the stress of battle.</p>

<p>Strongly reinforced, and with new heart, so soon
as night fell the tribesmen renewed their attack.
As illustrating the desperate nature of the fighting,
out of one picquet of twenty-five men of the 31st
Punjab Infantry, the native officer and eighteen men
were killed or wounded; while out of another picquet,
consisting of the Guides and forty-five Sikhs, twenty-one
were killed or wounded; and all this was done
in close hand to hand fighting. Lieutenant Lockhart
thus describes the scene:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It was a veritable pandemonium that would seem to
have been let loose around us. Bands of <i>ghazis</i>, worked
up by their religious enthusiasm into a frenzy of fanatical<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>
excitement, would charge our breastworks again and again,
leaving their dead in scores after each repulse, while those
of their comrades who were unarmed would encourage their
efforts by shouting, with much beating of tom-toms, and
other musical instruments. Amidst the discordant din
which raged around, we could even distinguish bugle calls,
evidently sounded by some <i>soi-disant</i> bugler of our native
army. As he suddenly collapsed in the middle of the
&quot;officers' mess call&quot; we concluded that a bullet had brought
him to an untimely end.[1]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p>[1] <i>A Frontier Campaign</i>; by the Viscount Fincastle, V.C., Lieutenant
16th Lancers, and P.C. Eliott-Lockhart, D.S.O., Lieutenant Queen's
Own Corps of Guides. London, 1898.</p></div>

<p>The fighting went on all night, and at daybreak
the garrison, to show that they were none the worse
for it, made a spirited counter attack, the 24th
Punjab Infantry under Lieutenant Climo, the senior
surviving officer, doing great execution. A desultory
fire was kept up by the enemy during the day,
while the British force improved their defences.</p>

<p>As darkness fell on the third night, the enemy,
undaunted and heavily reinforced from countries
as far afield as Buner, again advanced to the
attack, the brunt of which fell on the 31st Punjab
Infantry, a regiment so depleted by losses that Lieutenant
H. Maclean, of the Guides' cavalry, was
requisitioned to give a helping hand. This officer,
together with Lieutenants Ford and Swinley, were
severely wounded. Towards morning the attack
again died away, and the indomitable garrison still
held its own.</p>

<p>On the fourth night, in addition to bonfires placed<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>
out in front of the defences, to make the enemy's
movements clear, it was decided to try the effect of
mines, and portions of a serai, lately occupied by
the Sappers and now abandoned, were accordingly
undermined. At nightfall the enemy immediately
seized this serai as an advance post to further
their attack, and when it was crowded the mine was
fired with fatal results. For a time a death-like
silence reigned, the enemy being apparently thunderstruck
at the awful disaster. Minor attacks, however,
were still persisted in, and the tribesmen did not
draw off till three in the morning.</p>

<p>A fifth night had barely settled down on the
garrison when, undeterred by four unsuccessful and
costly attacks, or by the terrors of unseen mines,
the enemy again swarmed down on the weary but
undismayed defenders. To add to their difficulties,
a severe dust storm, followed by torrents
of rain, fell on the camp, and at the height of the
storm a most determined attack was made on the
45th Sikhs, but was repulsed with great loss. Sitting
drenched to the skin the garrison patiently
awaited the dawn.</p>

<p>That day, the 31st of July, brought welcome reinforcements,
consisting of the 35th Sikhs and the
38th Dogras, under Colonel Reid. Thus strengthened,
Colonel Meiklejohn determined to take the
offensive, and attempt to force his way to the
assistance of the isolated garrison of Chakdara.
The cavalry, consisting of the Guides and 11th Bengal<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>
Lancers, were to lead the way, but these regiments
before they could get into the open were so strongly
attacked in the rocky defiles from which they tried
to issue, that they could make no headway and had
to return to camp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Bindon Blood had arrived to take
over the command, and decided to postpone further
endeavours to relieve Chakdara till the next day.
The intervening night seems to have been a quiet
one, and before dawn the British force commenced
to move. The attack was unexpected at so early an
hour: the enemy were surprised and driven out from
the heights to the east of the Malakand position; and
the command of ground thus gained enabled this
successful column to clear the flank of the exit from
the Malakand, and to ensure the unopposed initial
advance of the main body. Before reaching the
open valley, however, strong parties of the enemy
were found holding the rocky spurs and kopjes
intervening. These after sharp fighting were carried
with the bayonet by the Guides, 35th and 45th Sikhs,
and the way was opened, the cavalry doing great
execution amongst the flying enemy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the small garrison of Chakdara had,
for the space of six days and nights, been undergoing
no mean adventures. It will be remembered that
Lieutenants Rattray and Minchin (the Political
Officer) were, on the afternoon of July 26th, playing
polo at Khar, some seven or eight miles away down
the Swat Valley. Warned there of impending<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>
trouble they rode back through the gathering storm
to their post, the little fort of Chakdara situated on
the north bank of the Swat River. Soon after ten
o'clock that night a beacon, lighted by a friendly
hand across the valley, gave timely notice that an
attack was imminent. The garrison, two companies
of the 45th Sikhs and twenty men of the 11th Bengal
Lancers, hurried to their posts, and after a short
delay the assault began, and never ceased for the best
part of a week!</p>

<p>The fort was badly situated for defence, being
indeed more a bridge-head guard than a fort. The
rock on which it stood was commanded by a great
spur running down to it from the west; and the only
obstacle that prevented that spur being occupied in
full by the enemy was a small tower, used for signalling
purposes and occupied by a few Sikhs. The story
of that little post is an epic in itself; surrounded
on all sides, isolated from all help, with scanty food,
and at the end no water, for six days and nights it
gallantly held its own.</p>

<p>As for the fort itself, it was so completely commanded
by the fire from the spurs that to move about
in it was to court death. Yet thus glued to the
walls, and assailed night and day by brave warriors
whose numbers rose rapidly from fifteen hundred
to over ten thousand, a few young British officers
with a couple of hundred Sikhs again and again
rolled back the tide of war. The history of
that week was as the history of the Malakand,<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>
continuous attacks by night and day; but the
execution done on the enemy, considering the smallness
of the garrison, was comparatively higher;
statistics are difficult to gather, but a fairly accurate
estimate puts their loss at two thousand. And, to
illustrate the indomitable courage and unflagging
spirit with which the defence was maintained to the
end, when on the last day the thrice welcome sight
of the Guides' cavalry and the 11th Bengal Lancers,
coming over the Amandara Pass, met the view of
that weary little band, they in their turn became the
attackers, and, led by the undaunted Rattray, sallied
forth and stormed the enemy's positions. To
Hedley Wright who commanded, and to Rattray
and Wheatley who were the soul of the defence,
as well as to the gallant Sikhs, is due the admiration
of every soldier who loves to hear of a good fight
fought out to the end as British officers and men led
by them know how to fight it.</p>

<p>As at the Malakand, so at Chakdara, and so times
without number, it is the gallant British subaltern, in
spite of silly chatter, who again and again has shown
the highest attributes of an officer and a soldier.
It is the foolish custom of a certain class of Englishman
to decry all that is their own; and amongst
the latest of these victims of a dyspeptic imagination
is the British officer. Men call him stupid, who
would themselves have no chance of passing the
intellectual test which every young officer has to go
through. Sitting safe and smug at home they libel<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>
the courage and devotion of the gallant gentleman
who is giving his life for them. Perhaps against
these may be placed the word of an old soldier, who
for thirty years has seen the British officer, as fighter,
diplomatist, and administrator, in all parts of the
world, and who has not lightly come to the conclusion
that he has not his better in the army of any country,
and is only equalled by his brother of the British
Navy.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Marshalling and redistributing his forces, Sir
Bindon Blood, after the relief of Chakdara, proceeded
systematically to punish the tribes involved
in the late fanatical upheaval. Amongst the first
to be so dealt with were the tribesmen of the Upper
Swat, and the action of Land&#257;ki was the result.</p>

<p>The tribesmen held a position on a big spur
running down from the mountains, and meeting an
unfordable river with a steep cliff. Round the face
of this cliff a narrow causeway led to a fairly
open valley beyond. It was the business of the
infantry to clear this spur, or ridge, and this they
accomplished after some severe climbing and hard
fighting. As the defeated enemy were seen streaming
across the valley, making for a further ridge two
or three miles in the rear, the Guides' cavalry were
let loose in pursuit; but before debouching into the
valley they had to pass along the causeway, some
three-quarters of a mile in length, in single file. As<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>
everyone knows, who has experience of single file
work, even a moderate pace in front means inevitable
straggling behind. The officer leading, in his
eagerness to get at the enemy, lost sight of this fact,
and so soon as he made the valley, with the first
few men set off at a round pace after the enemy.
At the head of the pursuit was also Lieutenant
R.T. Greaves, of the Lancashire Fusiliers, who
was acting as war-correspondent to a newspaper.
After traversing a mile, and leaving the men further
and further behind, the two officers saw the enemy
passing through a wooded graveyard and on to
a spur some eighty yards in the rear.</p>

<p>Colonel Adams, who was coming up fast with the
main body, shouted to the two officers to stop, but
owing to the noise of firing could not make himself
heard. He at once saw that the place to seize was the
graveyard, cavalry pursuit up a rocky hill being
naturally impracticable, and from there to open fire
on the retreating enemy. He therefore at once
seized the graveyard with dismounted men. To
describe the events of the next few minutes it had best
be done in the words of an officer who was an eye-witness
and whose account appears in <i>A Frontier
Campaign</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On Palmer and Greaves approaching the hill, they were
subject to a heavy fire from the enemy. Palmer's horse
was at once killed, whilst Greaves, having been shot at close
quarters, fell, some twenty yards further on, among the
Pathans, who at once proceeded to hack at him with their
swords. Seeing this, Adams and Fincastle went out to his
assistance followed by two sowars, who galloped towards<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>
Palmer, at that moment engaged in hand-to-hand conflict
with a standard-bearer. Palmer had been shot through the
right wrist and was only saved by the opportune appearance
of these two men, who enabled him to get back to the
shelter of the zi&#257;rat in safety. Meanwhile Fincastle, who
had had his horse killed while galloping up to where
Greaves lay, tried to lift Greaves on to Adams's horse, in
the process of which Greaves was again shot through the
body, and Adams's horse wounded. They were soon
joined by the two sowars who had been to Palmer's
assistance, and almost immediately after by Maclean, who
having first dismounted his squadron in the zi&#257;rat, had
very pluckily ridden out with four of his men to the
assistance of this small party, who otherwise would have
been rushed by the enemy. With his assistance Greaves
was successfully brought in, but unfortunately Maclean,
who had dismounted in order to help in lifting the body
on to his horse, was shot through both thighs and died
almost immediately.</p></div>

<p>Of the survivors Colonel Adams and Lord
Fincastle received the Victoria Cross for their
valour on this occasion; while ten years after, as a
graceful tribute to the heroism of the dead, the
Victoria Cross was also bestowed on Hector Maclean,
and sent to his family. As Lord Fincastle was
attached to the Guides during the campaign the
probably unique historic record was established of
three officers in one regiment earning the Victoria
Cross on the same day. Nor were the men
forgotten, all those who had shown conspicuous
gallantry being decorated with the Order of Merit.</p>

<h4>THE HOME OF THE GUIDES</h4>


<p>When the Guides about the middle of the last
century first pitched their wandering tents in the
plains of Yusafzai they were only birds of passage,
in hot pursuit of some band of marauders, or swiftly
marching to surprise a distant stronghold. But as
the border became more settled, and sudden movements
were less seldom called for, a position was chosen
within striking distance of all the centres of disturbance.
And thus came to be selected the site of the
little cantonment, which since has sent forth
generations of steel-bred warriors to keep bright
the ancient flame; a small oasis, rescued by rough
but kindly hands from the dry and desolate
desert, and which the leisure of sixty years has
served to turn into the beautiful and cherished
home of the Guides.</p>

<p>The camp in due course shed its white wings
and became a dust-hued fort. As seen by an eagle
soaring overhead, its shape is that of a five-pointed<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>
star, and on four of the points stood the officers'
quarters, while on the fifth were the magazine and
<i>place d'armes</i>. All round the inside of the star,
tucked away under the parapets, were the rude
shelters of the infantry, while a hornwork held the
troops of cavalry. For a few hundred yards round
the jungle and scrub were cleared away, a Union
Jack run up to the modest mast-head on the keep,
and H&ocirc;ti-Mardan Fort became not only the home
of the Guides, but also the symbol of British power
on the wild borders of Y&#257;ghistan, the land of
everlasting conflict and of unending vendettas.</p>

<p>It was the pride of a far-distant generation to
name the bastions of the old fort after famous
leaders who had gone before: Lumsden, the genial
dashing soldier, who stamped his type on the small
beginnings; Hodson, the far-famed leader of light
horse; Daly, whose steadfast resolve carried through
the great march to Delhi; Sam Browne, the one-armed
hero of a hundred fights.</p>

<p>Soon after the Mutiny the fort began to overflow,
for the country was now getting more settled,
and British officers could venture to build houses
outside the walls of fortified enclosures. Thus the
Assistant-Commissioner migrated eight hundred
yards to the south-east, while an officers' mess was
built on the river bank two hundred yards to the
north-west. A quarter of a century passed before
more houses were added, and then at intervals of a
few years came the church and more houses, while<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>
extensions of the soldiers' lines took place to
accommodate the increasing numbers.</p>

<p>And thus it stands to-day, the little five-bastioned
fort, round which are loosely thrown half a dozen
houses and a church. And yet there is a difference,
for the picture is now set, not in dull desert tints, but
in soft shades of green. Everywhere are avenues and
clumps of great trees, hedges of roses, of limes, and
deronta encircle every garden, the green of the polo
grounds is as that of the Emerald Isle. Even the
old fort has lost its grimness, and the mud walls
have given place to beautiful terraces bright with
every flower; while the once formidable moat is
spanned by peaceful rustic bridges, clustered thick
with climbing roses, and giving access to the gardens
and orchards which spread along the <i>glacis</i>.</p>

<p>On the Hodson bastion stands the old mess, now
an officers' quarter, where in bygone stormy days
they used to sit at dinner with revolvers handy,
and swords stacked in the corner, alert and
ready for sudden alarm or excursion. A strange
imprint of those old times remained for many years,
a bullet-mark high up in one corner of the dining-room;
and this bullet, according to tradition, was
fired at dinner by Sir Sam Browne, who was a
deadly shot, and nailed to the wall the tail of a cobra
which was disappearing into a crevice.</p>

<p>Passing near the Hodson bastion and running
to the present mess is Godby-road, named after
General C.J. Godby, who after nearly losing his<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>
head from a sabre stroke in the Sikh War, again well-nigh
lost it near this spot at the hands of a ghazi.
The incident affords an early instance of the ready
resource which has always been one of the typical
characteristics of the Guides. When Godby was cut
down by a treacherous blow there happened to be
two or three men within hail, and these at once
dashed to the rescue; but they were disarmed, while
the fanatic brandished a razor-edged Afghan blade,
and was prepared to sell his life dearly. Sharp
eyes and ready wit, however, came to aid. Close by
was a tent pitched, the guy ropes tied to long heavy
wooden pegs such as are used in India. As quick
as thought the tent was struck, the pegs wrenched
from the ground, and the ghazi surrounded, overpowered,
secured, and incidentally in due course
hanged.</p>

<p>The present mess is full not only of historical
mementoes, as is only natural, but also of arch&aelig;ological
treasures of great value and antiquity. On the
walls captured banners, swords and daggers, guns
and pistols, share the honours with portraits of old
commanders and of the mighty dead with their
swords beneath them. Over the anteroom mantelpiece
is a very gracious picture of Queen Victoria,
presented by her Majesty in 1876; and this is
flanked by pictures of King Edward the Seventh,
who is Colonel-in-Chief of the corps, and Queen
Alexandra, both presented by their Majesties when
they were Prince and Princess of Wales. Over the<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>
mantelpiece in the dining-room is an excellent oil
painting of Sir Harry Lumsden, who raised the corps.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting relics is one leaf of a
mahogany table, captured at the siege of Delhi and
used in camp on the Ridge; the other two leaves
were taken by the 60th Rifles and the 2nd
Gurkhas, who lay alongside the Guides at Hindu
Rao's house. On the leaves are roughly carved
symbolic crests and mottoes for the three regiments:
A Maltese Cross and <i>Celer et Audax</i> for the 60th
Rifles; crossed swords and <i>Stout and Steady</i> for the
Gurkhas; and crossed Afghan knives with <i>Rough
and Ready</i> for the Guides. On this latter leaf may
be seen standing a cigar-lighter made out of grapeshot
picked up in camp during the siege.</p>

<p>High up on the walls all round are endless trophies
of the chase, probably the finest collection in
Asia&mdash;Ovis poli, Ovis Ammon, Ibex, markhor, bara
sing, and bison; besides specimens from other continents
whither officers have gone in pursuit of sport
or war. A splendid collection of plate testifies to
success in many a field of sport, polo, tent-pegging,
and shooting.</p>

<p>The arch&aelig;ological treasures consist of sculptures
and friezes of Greco-Buddhist origin, illustrating incidents
in the life of Buddha, while the statues represent
the great Gautama and some of his disciples.
Most of these are still in perfect preservation, though
varying from fifteen hundred to two thousand years
in antiquity. They were all discovered, many years<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>
ago, within a few miles of the mess, and are
naturally preserved with the greatest care. Savants
from even so far afield as France, Germany, and
America have journeyed to see them.</p>

<p>The mess stands in a five-acre garden, which has
been the joy of many generations; for, apart from its
abundant fertility, amidst its shades are to be found
a swimming-bath and racquet-court, as well as tennis,
badminton, and croquet lawns. Oranges, strawberries,
peaches, plums, apricots, grapes, loquats and other
fruits flourish and abound, while nearly every species
of English flower and vegetable grows strong and
well. Great trees give shade and peace to the place.
But perhaps the greatest attraction to the hot and
weary officer, and which leaves the most grateful
memory with the dusky warriors who march through
in war and peace, is the deep cool swimming-bath
alongside which under the trees is spread a breakfast
that suits the hour and climate. There are perhaps
few more grateful feelings than on a summer's
morning to come out of the fierce heat and dust and
glare of field-exercises, or a march from the
Malakand or Nowshera, and to find oneself in these
cool and comforting surroundings.</p>

<p>Just outside the garden is the old graveyard,
where rest in God the brave hearts who have
fought the good fight, and now with sword in sheath
watch with kindly pride the keen young blades who
follow in their steps. Side by side lie two of the<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>
heroic Battyes, Wigram and Fred, two of the four
brothers who died for their Queen and Country. As
has been related elsewhere, Wigram was killed in
1879 while charging at the head of his squadron at
Futtehabad in Afghanistan, and Fred fell mortally
wounded just as he had completed a most brilliant
operation at the Panjkora river, on the march to the
relief of Chitral in 1895. Close to them lies that
kindly, upright gentleman, beloved of all, Bob
Hutchinson, who fell at the head of the Guides
during a night attack on the border village of
Malandrai in 1886. A few yards in another direction
may be seen a stone to the memory of
A.M. Ommanney, a young officer who was
assassinated by a fanatic in mistake for his brother.
Besides these, and many other single graves, there
are large inclusive monuments to the memory of
the officers and men of various regiments who have
fought on these borders. Amongst them may be
seen those erected to the memory of the officers and
men of the 71st Highland Light Infantry, 93rd
Sutherland Highlanders, and 101st Royal Bengal
Fusiliers, all killed in the Umbeyla campaign of
1863.</p>

<p>Outside the old graveyard, standing at the meeting
of three roads, is a very fine mulberry tree, planted
at the spot where, according to old soldiers, Colonel
Spottiswoode, of the 55th Native Infantry, in deep
distress at the mutiny of his regiment, determined to<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>
take his own life rather than live to see it disgraced,
and under which, according to tradition, he lies
buried.</p>

<p>Passing through the bazaar, we come to the
Memorial arch and tank, erected by Government
to Major Sir Louis Cavignari, Mr. W. Jenkyns,
Lieutenant Walter Hamilton, V.C., Surgeon Kelly
and the native officers, non-commissioned-officers,
and men of the Guides who fell in the defence of
the Kabul Residency, September, 3rd, 1879. Just
outside the memorial garden is the spot where
Lieutenant A.M. Ommanney was assassinated, now
known as the Ommanney cross-roads.</p>

<p>Every road in the cantonment has a name, and
each name in itself is an honoured memory. Some
bear the names of old officers of the corps, while
others keep green the memory of those fallen in
war. Amongst the former will be found Sir Alfred
Wilde, Sir Charles Keyes, Sir Frances Jenkins, and
Sir John McQueen. Sir Alfred Wilde commanded
the corps with great distinction during the Umbeyla
campaign of 1863, and afterwards went on to
command the Punjab Frontier Force, as did also
Sir Charles Keyes. Of Sir Frances Jenkins a book
might be written, for his connection with the Guides
extended over nearly twenty-four years. He was
one of the most accomplished soldiers who have
ever served in the Indian Army and carried with
him much of the breezy skill in war of Sir Harry
Lumsden. Sir John McQueen also was a soldier<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>
of great renown, who afterwards commanded the
Punjab Frontier Force. Other roads bear the
names of Bob Hutchinson, who, as above recorded,
was killed in the night attack on Malandrai; Walter
Hamilton, killed in defence of the Kabul Residency;
Hector MacLean, who earned the Victoria Cross and
died to save a comrade at Land&#257;ki, in Swat;
Quentin Battye, who, mortally wounded, passed
peacefully away at Delhi with the words <i>Dulce et
decorum est pro patria mori</i> on his lips; Wigram
Battye, killed bravely charging in Afghanistan, and
Fred Battye, killed at the Panjkora. Great names
these all, and spreading still their soldier influence,
perhaps insensibly, over the spirit of their old
home and regiment.</p>

<p>Out beyond the cavalry parade-ground is the
Home Farm, and on each side of it run the cavalry
and infantry rifle-ranges, skirted by fine avenues of
trees. Between the infantry range and the church
are two of the best polo-grounds in India,&mdash;grounds
which have produced many famous players and many
famous teams. The church was erected by public subscription
to the memory of Colonel Hutchinson, and
claims the great attraction to sojourners in a foreign
land of being like a little English church. On the
walls are tablets to the memory of Sir Harry Lumsden;
Major F.H. Barton, the cheery, gallant sportsman
who was killed at polo in 1902; Major Gaikskill;
A.W. Wilde, son of Sir Alfred; Hector MacLean;
Quentin and Fred Battye; Major G.H. Bretherton,<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>
who was drowned on the way to Lhassa; Charlie
Keyes, son of Sir Charles, treacherously killed in
West Africa, and many others. The churchyard
is beautifully laid out with many rare plants,
flowers, and trees. There remains only, to finish up
with, the old cricket-ground, now used entirely for
lawn-tennis, badminton, and croquet; for cricket
flourishes not in India at this day, though doubtless
a revival may come before many years, as is so often
the case with games.</p>

<div><a name="pg194" id="pg194" /></div>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/jp194.jpg"
alt="The Church at Mardan"
title="The Church at Mardan"
width="532" height="362" /></div>

<p>The daily life at Mardan is much the same as in
any other Indian cantonment. In the early morning
comes parade or man&oelig;uvre, growing painfully
early as the brief hot weather creeps on. Stables
follow for the cavalry, and work in the lines for
the infantry. Next comes orderly-room for the
adjutants and others; and twice a week <i>durbar</i>.
The durbar in an Indian regiment takes the
place of the formal orderly-room of a British
regiment. It is held in the open, under the trees, or
at any convenient spot; and the underlying principle
is that any man in the regiment may be present to
hear, and, when called upon, to speak. It is a sort
of open court, whereat not only are delinquents
brought up for judgment, but all matters connected
with the welfare of the men, and especially
such as in any way touch their pockets or privileges,
are openly discussed. To add to the semi-informal
and friendly nature of the assembly, all the men are
allowed to wear plain clothes.<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></p>

<p>In the afternoon both officers and men are, as a
rule, free to amuse themselves with such sport and
games as may seem good to them. Round and
about Mardan there is fairly good small-game
shooting, the game-book in a good year showing
over three thousand head shot by the officers.
Amongst these are wild duck of many varieties, wild
geese, snipe, partridges, hare, and quail.</p>

<p>The ancient and royal sport of falconry, which
long flourished, has of late years become much
restricted owing to the increase of cultivation. One
of the highest forms of falconry, and one little known
in other countries, was the pursuit of the ravine
deer. Only falcons reared from the nest could be
trained to this sport, and they had to be obtained
from far off Central Asia. The falcon used was the
Cherug, or Saker as she is known in Europe, and
the method of training is interesting. From the
nest upwards the bird was taught that the only
possible place to obtain food was from between
a pair of antlers. At first fed sitting between
them, as she learnt to flutter she was encouraged
to bridge a short gap to her dinner. Then, as
she grew stronger, she flew short distances to
get her food as before. The next step was the
use of a stuffed deer on wheels, which, when the
hawk was loosed, was run along, and thus accustomed
her to the idea of movement in getting her food.
At the same time she was accustomed to the presence
of greyhounds, for without the aid of these she<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>
would never be able to bring down her quarry. For
the Pathan saying is: &quot;The first day a ravine deer
is born a fleet man may catch it; the second day a
dog; and the third day no one!&quot;</p>

<p>The hawks, which were flown in pairs, were now
taken into the field, keen set, to use a term in
falconry; that is very hungry, but not weakened or
disheartened by hunger. Directly a herd of deer was
sighted the hawks were cast loose, and, soaring up,
soon descried a seemingly familiar object with a
pair of antlers, between which there was doubtless a
delicious meal. Off, therefore, they went straight
for the quarry, and, stooping, struck for the deer's
antlers. Naturally, however, no bird of that size
could bring a deer to earth, or even stop him
unaided; but the hawks had done their initial work,
and the riders, with a couple of greyhounds leashed
to the stirrup, rode hard for the spot where the
hawks were striking, and let slip the hounds.</p>

<p>The rattle of hoofs at once stampeded the deer,
and then the chase began. The hawks, in turn
towering and stooping, showed the line to take, for
the deer was invisible to the dogs, and generally to
the riders. But the dogs had learnt to work by
the hawks, and cutting a corner here, or favoured
by a jink there, gradually closed up, the part of the
hawks being, by constant striking, to delay and
confuse the deer. It was a hard ride and a fine
combination which secured the quarry, and, as with
all sport worth the name, it was even chances on the<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>
deer. When the combination failed and the deer
got away, it was a bit of human nature to see the
meeting between the hawks and the dogs. The
hawks would be sitting on the ground or on a bush,
evidently and unmistakably using language of the
most sulphurous nature; while the dogs came up,
their tongues out, their tails between their legs, and
with a general air of exhaustion, dejection, and
apology. As they slunk up the muttered curses
broke forth: &quot;You! you lazy hound! Call
yourself a greyhound! You're a fat-tailed sheep,
that's what you are, nothing more!&quot; And up
would get friend hawk and cuff and strike and harry
that poor dog, till he fairly yelped and fled to his
master for protection.</p>

<p>Duck and bustard still afford sport to the falconer,
but he has to work further afield, and gets less
in return than in the olden times. The bustard gives
good sport, and often a good run of three or four
miles; indeed there is on record a case of an eleven
mile point.</p>

<p>On the mountain range which lies close to Mardan
markhor are to be found, and some good heads
have been shot; while in the lower slopes good
bags of chikore, black and grey partridge, and
rock-pigeons may be obtained. There are two
of the best polo-grounds in India, and the Guides
can generally put up a good team or two to compete
in the various tournaments, and generally one
or more challenge-cups are to be seen on their mess<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>
table. Racquets, tennis, and hockey, lime-cutting,
tent-pegging and other mounted sports are also
part of the weekly life; while friendly visits, given
and taken, keep touch with the neighbouring stations.</p>

<p>The climate of these parts is on the whole
eminently healthy and bracing. True, there are
four months of very hot weather, but they get lost
sight of in the keen delight of the other eight. Red
cheeks with buoyant activity and spirits carry their
own advertisement.</p>

<p>Thus, briefly described, has been the home of the
Guides for upwards of sixty years; a little kingdom
barely a mile square, but full of happy associations
for all who have lived there. It is a quiet, unassuming
spot, which year by year has bred, and
sent forth to fight, many a gallant officer and brave
soldier; and which in future years hopes to keep
bright the shining record of great deeds that have
gone before.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
